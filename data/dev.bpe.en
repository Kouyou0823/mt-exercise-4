L@@ ast ye@@ ar I show@@ ed these two s@@ li@@ de@@ s so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the si@@ ze of the low@@ er 4@@ 8 st@@ at@@ es, has sh@@ r@@ un@@ k by 4@@ 0 per@@ cent@@ .
But this underst@@ at@@ es the seri@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of this partic@@ ul@@ ar prob@@ le@@ m because it doesn't show the th@@ ick@@ n@@ ess of the ic@@ e.
The ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c ice ca@@ p is, in a sen@@ se, the be@@ ating hear@@ t of the glob@@ al c@@ lim@@ ate system@@ .
It ex@@ p@@ and@@ s in w@@ int@@ er and contr@@ ac@@ ts in su@@ m@@ mer@@ .
The next s@@ li@@ de I show you will be a ra@@ pi@@ d f@@ ast@@ -@@ for@@ war@@ d of wh@@ at's happen@@ ed over the last 2@@ 5 year@@ s.
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in re@@ d.
A@@ s you se@@ e, it ex@@ p@@ and@@ s to the dar@@ k bl@@ ue --
that's the an@@ nu@@ al ice in w@@ inter@@ , and it contr@@ ac@@ ts in su@@ m@@ mer@@ .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ic@@ e, fi@@ ve years old or ol@@ der@@ , you can see is al@@ most like b@@ loo@@ d, spi@@ ll@@ ing out of the body here.
In 2@@ 5 years it's g@@ one from this, to this.
This is a prob@@ le@@ m because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the fro@@ z@@ en gro@@ un@@ d around the A@@ r@@ c@@ ti@@ c O@@ ce@@ an, where there is a mas@@ si@@ ve am@@ oun@@ t of fro@@ z@@ en car@@ b@@ on wh@@ ich@@ , when it th@@ a@@ w@@ s, is tur@@ ned into me@@ th@@ an@@ e by m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ es.
Com@@ par@@ ed to the t@@ ot@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of glob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing po@@ ll@@ u@@ tion in the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here, that am@@ oun@@ t could d@@ ou@@ ble if we c@@ ros@@ s this ti@@ pp@@ ing po@@ int@@ .
Al@@ read@@ y in some sh@@ al@@ low la@@ kes in A@@ las@@ k@@ a, me@@ th@@ an@@ e is ac@@ tiv@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the wat@@ er.
P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ alt@@ er from the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of A@@ las@@ k@@ a went out with another te@@ am to another sh@@ al@@ low la@@ ke last w@@ inter@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o: Wh@@ o@@ a@@ ! A@@ l G@@ or@@ e: S@@ h@@ e's o@@ k@@ a@@ y. The quest@@ ion is wh@@ ether we will b@@ e.
And one reas@@ on is, this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and from the nor@@ th@@ .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver@@ .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much lar@@ g@@ er than ever@@ .
This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q R@@ i@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and@@ .
If you want to know how se@@ a l@@ ev@@ el ri@@ se@@ s from l@@ and@@ -@@ bas@@ e ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a.
Th@@ ese f@@ low@@ s are incre@@ as@@ ing very ra@@ pi@@ d@@ l@@ y.
A@@ t the other end of the plan@@ et@@ , An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ t@@ ica the lar@@ g@@ est mas@@ s of ice on the plan@@ et@@ .
L@@ ast mon@@ th sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s re@@ port@@ ed the enti@@ re contin@@ ent is now in ne@@ g@@ ative ice b@@ al@@ anc@@ e. And w@@ est An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ t@@ ica c@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed up on to@@ p some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ l@@ and@@ s, is partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly ra@@ pi@@ d in its m@@ el@@ t@@ ing.
That's e@@ qu@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of se@@ a l@@ ev@@ el@@ , as is G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and@@ .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as@@ , the th@@ ir@@ d lar@@ g@@ est mas@@ s of ic@@ e: at the to@@ p you see new la@@ k@@ es, which a few years ag@@ o were g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ er@@ s.
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get h@@ al@@ f of their d@@ r@@ in@@ king wat@@ er from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ low@@ .
In the An@@ de@@ s, this g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ er is the s@@ our@@ ce of d@@ r@@ in@@ king wat@@ er for this cit@@ y.
The f@@ low@@ s have incre@@ as@@ ed.
But when they go a@@ way, so does much of the d@@ r@@ in@@ king wat@@ er.
In C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a there has been a 4@@ 0 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ac@@ k.
This is h@@ it@@ ting the re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.
And the pre@@ dic@@ tion@@ s, as you@@ 've read@@ , are seri@@ ou@@ s.
This d@@ r@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c incre@@ ase in fi@@ re@@ s.
And the di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ab@@ solut@@ ely ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary and un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed rat@@ e.
F@@ our tim@@ es as many in the last 3@@ 0 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5@@ .
This is a complet@@ ely un@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ able p@@ atter@@ n@@ .
If you look at in the cont@@ ex@@ t of h@@ ist@@ or@@ y you can see what this is do@@ ing.
In the last fi@@ ve years we've ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ on@@ s of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s -- 2@@ 5 million t@@ on@@ s every day to the oce@@ an@@ s.

The bi@@ gg@@ est sing@@ le cause of glob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing, al@@ ong with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation, which is 20 percent of it, is the b@@ ur@@ ning of fos@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ s.

And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to buil@@ d a lot more co@@ al pl@@ ant@@ s.
But we're be@@ gin@@ ning to see a se@@ a chang@@ e.
H@@ ere are the on@@ es that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ po@@ se@@ d.
H@@ ow@@ ever there is a polit@@ ical b@@ att@@ le in our coun@@ tr@@ y.

Th@@ is, all over the coun@@ tr@@ y, is the secon@@ d lar@@ g@@ est wa@@ st@@ e stre@@ am in Americ@@ a.

Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
L@@ ast ye@@ ar at TED I g@@ ave an int@@ ro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
And I pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ k@@ ed.
So this is it. And for those of you that w@@ er@@ en@@ 't ther@@ e, the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ g@@ est sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent ever att@@ em@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 ki@@ lo@@ met@@ ers in cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ enc@@ e.
It@@ s jo@@ b is to re@@ cre@@ ate the con@@ dit@@ ions that were pres@@ ent l@@ ess than a bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ th of a secon@@ d after the uni@@ ver@@ se be@@ g@@ an, up to 6@@ 00 million tim@@ es a secon@@ d.
It's no@@ thing if not amb@@ iti@@ ou@@ s.
This is the ma@@ ch@@ ine be@@ low G@@ en@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang@@ s insi@@ de de@@ tec@@ tor@@ s.
This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ tec@@ t@@ or -- 4@@ 4 met@@ ers w@@ ide@@ , 2@@ 2 met@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er.
S@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar pic@@ ture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S un@@ der con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale.
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last ye@@ ar we tur@@ ned the ma@@ ch@@ ine on for the first time.
And this pic@@ ture was ta@@ k@@ en by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ .
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se c@@ ele@@ br@@ ation in the contro@@ l ro@@ om@@ .
It's a pic@@ ture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , coll@@ i@@ ding with a pi@@ ece of the L@@ H@@ C de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ el@@ y, and show@@ er@@ ing partic@@ les into the de@@ tec@@ tor@@ .
In other wor@@ d@@ s, when we sa@@ w that pic@@ ture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 0@@ th we k@@ new the ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ k@@ ed, which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
I don't know wh@@ ether this got the bi@@ gg@@ est ch@@ e@@ er, or this, when some@@ one went on@@ to Go@@ og@@ le and sa@@ w the fron@@ t p@@ age was like that.
It mean@@ s we made cul@@ tu@@ ral imp@@ ac@@ t as w@@ ell as sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c imp@@ ac@@ t.
A@@ b@@ out a we@@ e@@ k lat@@ er we had a prob@@ le@@ m with the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e, rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these g@@ old wi@@ re@@ s.
Th@@ ose wi@@ re@@ s car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thou@@ s@@ and amp@@ s when the ma@@ ch@@ ine is wor@@ king in ful@@ l pow@@ er.
Now the en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers am@@ on@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say, "@@ N@@ o they don@@ '@@ t. Th@@ ey@@ 're sm@@ all wi@@ re@@ s@@ ."
They can do that because when they are very co@@ ld they are wh@@ at's called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es, col@@ der than the sp@@ ace between the star@@ s, those wi@@ re@@ s can take that cur@@ r@@ ent@@ .
In one of the jo@@ int@@ s between over 9@@ ,000 ma@@ gn@@ et@@ s in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up s@@ li@@ ght@@ ly, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 amp@@ s su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ anc@@ e.
This was the re@@ sul@@ t.
Now that's more im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve when you consi@@ der those ma@@ gn@@ et@@ s we@@ i@@ gh over 20 t@@ on@@ s, and they mov@@ ed about a fo@@ ot@@ .
So we d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed about 50 of the ma@@ gn@@ et@@ s.
We had to take them ou@@ t, which we di@@ d.
We re@@ con@@ dit@@ ion@@ ed them all@@ , fi@@ x@@ ed them.
Th@@ ey@@ 're all on their way back under@@ gro@@ un@@ d no@@ w.
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ ac@@ t again@@ .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on, and we ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t to take d@@ ata in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ ul@@ y, and continu@@ e with our qu@@ est to find out what the buil@@ ding blo@@ c@@ ks of the uni@@ ver@@ se are.
Now of cour@@ se, in a way those acci@@ dent@@ s re@@ i@@ gn@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the val@@ ue of sci@@ ence and en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing at the ed@@ g@@ e. It's e@@ as@@ y to re@@ fut@@ e.
I think that the fac@@ t that it's so diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t, the fac@@ t that we're over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing, is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I will le@@ ave the fin@@ al wor@@ d to an E@@ n@@ gli@@ s@@ h sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y, wh@@ o, I s@@ us@@ pe@@ c@@ t, when de@@ f@@ end@@ ing his pro@@ te@@ g@@ e's us@@ el@@ ess ex@@ per@@ iment@@ s -- his pro@@ te@@ ge was M@@ ich@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ a@@ y -- said this, "@@ No@@ thing is so d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to the pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s of the human min@@ d than to as@@ su@@ me that our vi@@ e@@ w@@ s of sci@@ ence are ulti@@ mat@@ e, that there are no m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ es in natu@@ re, that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."
Thank you.
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a ki@@ d, pla@@ ying with blo@@ c@@ k@@ s.
A@@ s you fi@@ gu@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ asp@@ , pic@@ k them up and mo@@ ve them ar@@ oun@@ d, you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve problem@@ s by underst@@ and@@ ing and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
S@@ p@@ ati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ e@@ pl@@ y con@@ nec@@ ted to how we underst@@ and a lot of the world around us@@ .
So, as a computer sci@@ ent@@ is@@ t in@@ spi@@ red by this uti@@ lit@@ y of our inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ s with ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical ob@@ jec@@ ts -- al@@ ong with my ad@@ vi@@ s@@ er P@@ atti@@ e, and my coll@@ abor@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to won@@ der -- what if when we used a comput@@ er, in@@ ste@@ ad of hav@@ ing this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a di@@ g@@ it@@ al f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p mov@@ ing around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ t@@ op@@ , what if we could re@@ ach in with bot@@ h h@@ and@@ s and gr@@ as@@ p in@@ form@@ ation ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally,
ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it the way we want@@ ed@@ ?
This quest@@ ion was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we deci@@ ded to ex@@ pl@@ ore the ans@@ w@@ er, by buil@@ ding S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es.
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell, a S@@ if@@ t@@ able is an inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve computer
the si@@ ze of a co@@ o@@ ki@@ e.
Th@@ ey@@ 're able to be mov@@ ed around by h@@ and, they can sen@@ se each other@@ , they can sen@@ se their mo@@ tion@@ , and they have a sc@@ re@@ en and a wi@@ rel@@ ess ra@@ di@@ o.
M@@ os@@ t import@@ ant@@ ly, they're ph@@ y@@ sic@@ al, so like the blo@@ c@@ k@@ s, you can mo@@ ve them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ asp@@ ing.
And S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les are an ex@@ amp@@ le of a new e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m of to@@ ol@@ s for man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation.
And as these to@@ ol@@ s be@@ come more ph@@ y@@ sic@@ al, more a@@ w@@ are of their mo@@ tion@@ , a@@ w@@ are of each other@@ , and a@@ w@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we mo@@ ve them@@ , we can start to ex@@ pl@@ ore some new and f@@ un inter@@ ac@@ tion st@@ y@@ l@@ es.
So, I'm going to start with some sim@@ p@@ le ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es.
This S@@ if@@ t@@ able is con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red to show vide@@ o, and if I ti@@ l@@ t it in one dire@@ c@@ tion@@ , it@@ 'll ro@@ ll the vide@@ o this wa@@ y@@ ; if I ti@@ l@@ t it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s.
And these inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve port@@ ra@@ its are a@@ w@@ are of each other@@ .
So if I put them next to each other@@ , they get interest@@ ed.
If they get sur@@ ro@@ un@@ de@@ d, they no@@ tic@@ e that to@@ o,
they might get a little f@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ ed.
And they can also sen@@ se their mo@@ tion and ti@@ l@@ t.
O@@ ne of the interest@@ ing im@@ plic@@ ations on inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ , we started to re@@ ali@@ z@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day g@@ est@@ u@@ re@@ s on dat@@ a, like p@@ our@@ ing a colo@@ r the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qui@@ d.
So in this cas@@ e, we've got three S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red to be pa@@ int b@@ uc@@ k@@ et@@ s and I can use them to p@@ our colo@@ r into that cent@@ ral one,
where they get mi@@ x@@ ed.
If we over@@ sh@@ o@@ ot@@ , we can p@@ our a little bit bac@@ k.
There are also some ne@@ at possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es for ed@@ uc@@ ation, like lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e, mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c g@@ am@@ es where we want to give people the abilit@@ y to try things qu@@ ick@@ ly, and vi@@ e@@ w the re@@ sul@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.
So here I'm --
This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ ci se@@ qu@@ ence that I'm ma@@ king with a sim@@ p@@ le e@@ qu@@ ation program@@ .
H@@ ere we have a wor@@ d g@@ ame that's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ c@@ ra@@ b@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le.
B@@ as@@ ic@@ ally, in every ro@@ un@@ d you get a ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly as@@ sign@@ ed l@@ etter on each S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ le, and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks again@@ st a dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ y.
Th@@ en, after about 3@@ 0 secon@@ d@@ s, it re@@ sh@@ u@@ ff@@ l@@ es, and you have a new se@@ t of let@@ ter@@ s and new possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es to tr@@ y.
Thank you.
So these are some ki@@ ds that came on a fi@@ el@@ d tri@@ p to the M@@ edi@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it ou@@ t, and sh@@ oo@@ t a vide@@ o.
They really lo@@ v@@ ed it.
An@@ d, one of the interest@@ ing things about this kind of ap@@ plic@@ ation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tion@@ s.
A@@ ll you have to say is, "@@ Ma@@ ke wor@@ d@@ s@@ ," and they know ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what to do.
So her@@ e's another few people trying it ou@@ t.
That's our y@@ oun@@ g@@ est bet@@ a test@@ er, down there on the ri@@ gh@@ t.
T@@ ur@@ n@@ s ou@@ t, all he wanted to do was to st@@ ac@@ k the S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les up@@ .
So to h@@ im@@ , they were just blo@@ c@@ k@@ s.
Now, this is an inter@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve car@@ to@@ on ap@@ plic@@ ation.
And we wanted to buil@@ d a lear@@ ning to@@ o@@ l for lan@@ gu@@ age lear@@ ner@@ s. And this is F@@ e@@ li@@ x@@ , actu@@ all@@ y.
And he can br@@ ing new ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s into the sc@@ en@@ e,
just by lif@@ ting the S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter sh@@ own on them.
H@@ ere, h@@ e's br@@ ing@@ ing the s@@ un ou@@ t.
V@@ ide@@ o: The s@@ un is ris@@ ing.
D@@ av@@ i@@ d M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ : Now h@@ e's b@@ rou@@ ght a tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or into the sc@@ en@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: The or@@ ang@@ e tr@@ ac@@ tor@@ .
G@@ ood j@@ ob@@ ! Y@@ ea@@ h@@ !
D@@ M@@ : So by sh@@ a@@ king the S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les and p@@ ut@@ ting them next to each other he can make the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s inter@@ ac@@ t --
V@@ ide@@ o: W@@ oo@@ f@@ !
D@@ M@@ : invent@@ ing his own n@@ ar@@ r@@ ativ@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: H@@ ell@@ o@@ !
D@@ M@@ : It's an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded stor@@ y,
and he get@@ s to deci@@ de how it un@@ f@@ ol@@ d@@ s.
V@@ ide@@ o: F@@ ly a@@ way, cat@@ .
D@@ M@@ : So, the last ex@@ amp@@ le I have time to show you to@@ day is a mu@@ si@@ c se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ing and li@@ ve per@@ for@@ man@@ ce to@@ o@@ l
that we've buil@@ t re@@ cent@@ ly,
in which S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les ac@@ t as so@@ un@@ ds like le@@ ad@@ , bas@@ s and d@@ ru@@ m@@ s.
E@@ ach of these has f@@ our different v@@ ari@@ ation@@ s, you get to ch@@ oo@@ se which one you want to us@@ e.
And you can in@@ jec@@ t these so@@ un@@ ds into a se@@ qu@@ ence that you can as@@ sem@@ ble into the p@@ atter@@ n that you want@@ .
And you in@@ jec@@ t it by just bu@@ m@@ p@@ ing up the so@@ un@@ d S@@ if@@ t@@ able again@@ st a se@@ qu@@ ence S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ le.
There are eff@@ ec@@ ts that you can contro@@ l liv@@ e, like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter@@ .
You att@@ ach it to a partic@@ ul@@ ar so@@ un@@ d and then ti@@ l@@ t to ad@@ just it.
And th@@ en, over@@ all eff@@ ec@@ ts like tempo and vol@@ u@@ me that ap@@ pl@@ y to the enti@@ re se@@ qu@@ enc@@ e.
So let@@ 's have a loo@@ k.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M@@ : We@@ 'll start by p@@ ut@@ ting a le@@ ad into two se@@ qu@@ ence S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ l@@ es, ar@@ r@@ ang@@ e them into a seri@@ es, ex@@ ten@@ d it, ad@@ d a little more le@@ ad@@ .
Now I put a bas@@ s l@@ ine in.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M@@ : Now I'll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M@@ : And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the d@@ ru@@ m@@ s, so I can contro@@ l the eff@@ ec@@ t liv@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M@@ : I can spe@@ ed up the whole se@@ qu@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tempo one way or the other@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M@@ : And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M@@ : I can re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ e the se@@ qu@@ ence wh@@ ile it pla@@ y@@ s.
So I don't have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ v@@ anc@@ e, but I can im@@ pro@@ vi@@ se, ma@@ king it lon@@ g@@ er or sh@@ or@@ ter as I g@@ o.
And no@@ w, fin@@ ally, I can f@@ ad@@ e the whole se@@ qu@@ ence out us@@ ing the vol@@ u@@ me S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ le, ti@@ l@@ ted to the le@@ f@@ t.
Thank you.
So, as you can se@@ e, my pas@@ sion is for ma@@ king new hu@@ man@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ in@@ s and bo@@ di@@ es wor@@ k.
And to@@ da@@ y, I had time to show you one po@@ int in this new design sp@@ ac@@ e, and a few of the possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es that we're wor@@ king to br@@ ing out of the l@@ abor@@ ator@@ y.
So the thought I want to le@@ ave you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of to@@ ol@@ s for inter@@ ac@@ ting with di@@ g@@ it@@ al medi@@ a that are going to br@@ ing in@@ form@@ ation into our world on our ter@@ m@@ s.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I look for@@ war@@ d to tal@@ king with all of you.
I am a w@@ rit@@ er.
W@@ rit@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks is my prof@@ essi@@ on but it's more than that, of cour@@ s@@ e.
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong lo@@ ve and f@@ as@@ cin@@ ation.
And I don't ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t that that's ever going to chang@@ e.
B@@ ut@@ , that said, something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happen@@ ed re@@ cent@@ ly in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er, which has ca@@ used me to have to re@@ c@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this wor@@ k.
And the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that I re@@ cent@@ ly w@@ ro@@ te this bo@@ o@@ k, this mem@@ o@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at@@ , P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ ov@@ e@@ " wh@@ ich@@ , deci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ o@@ k@@ s, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and be@@ came this bi@@ g@@ , me@@ g@@ a@@ -@@ sen@@ s@@ ation, inter@@ n@@ ational b@@ est@@ se@@ ll@@ er thing.
The re@@ sul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go no@@ w, people tre@@ at me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.
S@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !
L@@ i@@ k@@ e, they come up to me no@@ w, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "@@ A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d you're never going to be able to to@@ p that@@ ?
A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d you're going to ke@@ ep w@@ rit@@ ing for your whole life and you're never ag@@ a@@ in going to cre@@ ate a bo@@ ok that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all@@ ,
ever again@@ ?"
So that's reas@@ sur@@ ing, you know@@ .
But it would be wor@@ se, ex@@ ce@@ p@@ t for that I hap@@ pe@@ n to rem@@ em@@ ber that over 20 years ag@@ o, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started t@@ ell@@ ing people that I wanted to be a w@@ rit@@ er,
I was me@@ t with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ ac@@ tion@@ .
And people would say, "@@ A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d you're never going to have any succ@@ ess@@ ?
A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will k@@ ill you@@ ?
A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ i@@ d that you're going to work your whole life at this c@@ ra@@ ft and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to di@@ e on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of b@@ ro@@ k@@ en dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ ou@@ th fi@@ ll@@ ed with b@@ it@@ ter as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ ?"
L@@ i@@ ke that, you know@@ .
The ans@@ w@@ er -- the sh@@ or@@ t ans@@ w@@ er to all those question@@ s is, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."
Y@@ es, I'm af@@ ra@@ i@@ d of all those thing@@ s.
And I always have be@@ en@@ .
And I'm af@@ ra@@ i@@ d of man@@ y, many more things b@@ es@@ ide@@ s that people can't even gu@@ ess at@@ ,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ar@@ y.
B@@ ut@@ , when it comes to w@@ rit@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thin@@ king about lat@@ el@@ y, and won@@ der@@ ing about lat@@ el@@ y, is wh@@ y@@ ?
You know, is it r@@ ation@@ al@@ ?
I@@ s it lo@@ g@@ ical that any@@ body should be ex@@ pe@@ c@@ ted to be af@@ ra@@ i@@ d of the work that they fe@@ el they were put on this E@@ ar@@ th to do.
And what is it speci@@ fic@@ ally about cre@@ ative vent@@ u@@ re@@ s that se@@ em@@ s to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other@@ 's ment@@ al he@@ alt@@ h in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don't do, you know@@ ?
L@@ i@@ ke my d@@ ad@@ , for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, was a ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er and I don't re@@ call on@@ ce in his 4@@ 0 years of ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king hi@@ m if he was af@@ ra@@ i@@ d to be a ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er, you know@@ ?
"@@ That ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing blo@@ c@@ k, J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ , h@@ ow@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know@@ ?
But to be f@@ air@@ , ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers as a gro@@ up hav@@ en@@ 't really ear@@ ned a re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ h@@ ol@@ ic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ v@@ es.
We w@@ rit@@ er@@ s, we kind of do have that re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation, and not just w@@ rit@@ er@@ s, but cre@@ ative people ac@@ ros@@ s all gen@@ re@@ s, it se@@ em@@ s, have this re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ous@@ ly ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ ab@@ le.
And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m de@@ at@@ h coun@@ t in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y al@@ one, of really ma@@ gn@@ ific@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed y@@ oun@@ g and of@@ t@@ en at their own h@@ and@@ s, you know@@ ?
And even the on@@ es who didn't lit@@ er@@ ally com@@ mi@@ t su@@ ici@@ de se@@ e@@ m to be really un@@ d@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ t@@ s, you know@@ .
N@@ or@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er, just befor@@ e he di@@ ed, last inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w, he said, "@@ E@@ very one of my bo@@ o@@ ks has ki@@ ll@@ ed me a little mor@@ e@@ ." A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary st@@ at@@ em@@ ent to make about your lif@@ e's wor@@ k.
But we don't even bl@@ in@@ k when we he@@ ar some@@ body say this, because we've hear@@ d that kind of stu@@ f@@ f for so long and some@@ how we've complet@@ ely inter@@ n@@ ali@@ z@@ ed and acc@@ ep@@ ted coll@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y and su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing are some@@ how in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the en@@ d, will always ulti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ i@@ sh@@ .
And the quest@@ ion that I want to as@@ k every@@ body here to@@ day is are you gu@@ ys all co@@ o@@ l with that ide@@ a?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that@@ ? Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch a@@ way and, you know -- I'm not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that as@@ su@@ m@@ pt@@ ion@@ .
I think it's o@@ di@@ ou@@ s.
And I also think it's d@@ ang@@ er@@ ou@@ s, and I don't want to see it per@@ pet@@ u@@ ated into the next cent@@ ur@@ y.
I think it's better if we en@@ co@@ u@@ rag@@ e our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to liv@@ e.
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that, in my cas@@ e -- in my s@@ itu@@ ation -- it would be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous for me to start sort of le@@ a@@ king down that dar@@ k p@@ at@@ h of as@@ su@@ m@@ pt@@ ion@@ , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly gi@@ v@@ en the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that I'm in right now in my car@@ e@@ er.
Wh@@ ich is -- you know, like ch@@ ec@@ k it ou@@ t, I'm pre@@ tt@@ y y@@ oun@@ g@@ , I'm only about 4@@ 0 years ol@@ d.
I still have ma@@ ybe another f@@ our de@@ ca@@ de@@ s of work le@@ ft in me.
And it's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that any@@ thing I w@@ rit@@ e from this po@@ int for@@ war@@ d is going to be j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ is@@ h succ@@ ess of my last bo@@ o@@ k, ri@@ ght@@ ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly, because we're all sort of fri@@ end@@ s here now -- it's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that my gre@@ at@@ est succ@@ ess is be@@ h@@ in@@ d me.
So J@@ es@@ us@@ , what a thou@@ ght@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a per@@ son to start d@@ r@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o@@ '@@ clo@@ c@@ k in the mor@@ n@@ ing, and I don't want to go there.
I would pre@@ f@@ er to ke@@ ep doing this work that I lo@@ v@@ e.
And so, the quest@@ ion be@@ com@@ es, h@@ ow@@ ?
And so, it se@@ em@@ s to me, u@@ po@@ n a lot of re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion@@ , that the way that I have to work no@@ w, in or@@ der to continu@@ e w@@ rit@@ ing, is that I have to cre@@ ate some sort of pro@@ tec@@ ti@@ ve p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ struc@@ t, ri@@ ght@@ ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ f@@ e dist@@ ance between me, as I am w@@ rit@@ ing, and my very natu@@ ral an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that w@@ rit@@ ing is going to b@@ e, from now on. An@@ d, as I've been loo@@ k@@ ing, over the last year@@ , for mo@@ de@@ l@@ s for how to do that, I've been sort of looking ac@@ ros@@ s time, and I've been trying to find other societ@@ i@@ es to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ide@@ as than we have
about how to hel@@ p cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent em@@ ot@@ ion@@ al ris@@ ks of cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y.
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has l@@ ed me to an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ece and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ om@@ e.
So st@@ a@@ y with me, because it does cir@@ c@@ le around and bac@@ k.
B@@ ut@@ , an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ece and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ om@@ e -- people did not hap@@ pe@@ n to beli@@ eve that cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y came from human be@@ ing@@ s back th@@ en, OK@@ ?
P@@ e@@ ople beli@@ ev@@ ed that cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y was this di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ t that came to human be@@ ing@@ s from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able s@@ our@@ c@@ e, for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reas@@ on@@ s.
The G@@ re@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ous@@ ly called these di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ rit@@ s of cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s@@ ."
S@@ oc@@ rat@@ es, fam@@ ous@@ ly, beli@@ ev@@ ed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who s@@ po@@ ke w@@ is@@ do@@ m to hi@@ m from a@@ far@@ .
The R@@ om@@ an@@ s had the same ide@@ a, but they called that sort of di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative spi@@ ri@@ t a gen@@ i@@ us@@ .
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at@@ , because the R@@ om@@ an@@ s did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly cl@@ ever indi@@ vidu@@ al.
They beli@@ ev@@ ed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ it@@ y, who was beli@@ ev@@ ed to lit@@ er@@ ally li@@ ve in the w@@ all@@ s of an arti@@ st@@ 's studi@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the h@@ ou@@ se el@@ f@@ , and who would come out and sort of in@@ vi@@ si@@ b@@ ly as@@ si@@ st the arti@@ st with their work and would sh@@ ap@@ e the out@@ come of that wor@@ k.
So bri@@ ll@@ i@@ ant -- there it is, right ther@@ e, that dist@@ ance that I'm tal@@ king about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ struc@@ t to pro@@ tec@@ t you from the re@@ sul@@ ts of your wor@@ k.
And every@@ one k@@ new that this is how it fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ed, ri@@ ght@@ ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent arti@@ st was pro@@ tec@@ ted from cer@@ ta@@ in thing@@ s, lik@@ e, for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, to@@ o much n@@ ar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sm@@ , ri@@ ght@@ ?
If your work was bri@@ ll@@ i@@ ant@@ , you coul@@ dn't take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it, every@@ body k@@ new that you had this di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you.
If your work b@@ om@@ be@@ d, not enti@@ re@@ ly your fa@@ ul@@ t, you know@@ ?
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one k@@ new your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ am@@ e.
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y in the W@@ est for a really long time.
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and every@@ thing chang@@ ed, and we had this big ide@@ a, and the big idea was@@ , let@@ 's put the indi@@ vidu@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the uni@@ ver@@ se ab@@ ove all go@@ ds and m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ es, and there's no more ro@@ o@@ m for m@@ y@@ st@@ ical cre@@ atu@@ re@@ s who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ in@@ e.
And it's the be@@ gin@@ ning of r@@ ational hu@@ man@@ is@@ m@@ , and people started to beli@@ eve that cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y came complet@@ ely from the sel@@ f of the indi@@ vidu@@ al.
And for the first time in h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, you start to he@@ ar people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us@@ , ra@@ ther than hav@@ ing a gen@@ i@@ us@@ .
And I got to tell you@@ , I think that was a hu@@ ge er@@ r@@ or@@ .
You know, I think that al@@ low@@ ing some@@ bod@@ y, one m@@ ere per@@ son to beli@@ eve that he or she is lik@@ e, the v@@ es@@ sel@@ , you know, like the fon@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the s@@ our@@ ce of all di@@ v@@ in@@ e, cre@@ ativ@@ e, un@@ know@@ ab@@ le, et@@ er@@ n@@ al m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ d@@ ge to@@ o much respon@@ si@@ bilit@@ y to put on one f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le, human p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e.
It's like as@@ king some@@ body to s@@ w@@ al@@ low the s@@ un@@ .
It just complet@@ ely war@@ p@@ s and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s, and it cre@@ at@@ es all these un@@ man@@ ag@@ e@@ able ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ c@@ e.
And I think the pres@@ su@@ re of that has been ki@@ ll@@ ing off our arti@@ st@@ s for the last 5@@ 00 year@@ s.
An@@ d, if this is tr@@ u@@ e, and I think it is tr@@ u@@ e, the quest@@ ion be@@ com@@ es, what no@@ w@@ ?
C@@ an we do this differ@@ ent@@ l@@ y@@ ?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent underst@@ and@@ ing about the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between hu@@ man@@ s and the cre@@ ative m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y.
Ma@@ ybe no@@ t.
Ma@@ ybe we can't just er@@ ase 5@@ 00 years of r@@ ational hu@@ man@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 1@@ 8 min@@ ute spe@@ e@@ ch@@ .
And there's prob@@ ably people in this au@@ di@@ ence who would ra@@ i@@ se really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c s@@ us@@ pic@@ ions about the no@@ tion of@@ , bas@@ ic@@ ally, f@@ ai@@ ri@@ es who fo@@ ll@@ ow people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing f@@ air@@ y j@@ u@@ ice on their projec@@ ts and stu@@ ff@@ .
I'm no@@ t, prob@@ ab@@ ly, going to br@@ ing you all al@@ ong with me on this.
But the quest@@ ion that I kind of want to po@@ se is -- you know, why not@@ ?
Wh@@ y not think about it this wa@@ y@@ ?
Because it ma@@ kes as much sen@@ se as any@@ thing el@@ se I have ever hear@@ d in ter@@ m@@ s of ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing the ut@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ric@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of the cre@@ ative proc@@ ess@@ .
A proc@@ ess wh@@ ich@@ , as any@@ body who has ever tri@@ ed to make something -- which is to say bas@@ ically every@@ one here -@@ -- know@@ s does not always be@@ have r@@ ation@@ all@@ y.
An@@ d, in fac@@ t, can som@@ et@@ im@@ es fe@@ el do@@ wn@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal@@ .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter re@@ cent@@ ly where I me@@ t the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary Americ@@ an po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h St@@ one, wh@@ o@@ 's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s, but sh@@ e's been a po@@ et her enti@@ re life and she t@@ old me that when she was gro@@ w@@ ing up in ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a, she would be out wor@@ king in the fi@@ el@@ d@@ s, and she said she would fe@@ el and he@@ ar a po@@ e@@ m com@@ ing at her from over the l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e.
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air@@ .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e.
And she fel@@ t it com@@ ing, because it would sh@@ a@@ ke the ear@@ th un@@ der her fe@@ et@@ .
S@@ he k@@ new that she had only one thing to do at that po@@ int@@ , and that was to, in her wor@@ d@@ s, "@@ r@@ un like h@@ ell@@ ."
And she would r@@ un like h@@ ell to the h@@ ou@@ se and she would be gett@@ ing ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em@@ , and the whole de@@ al was that she had to get to a pi@@ ece of pa@@ per and a pen@@ ci@@ l f@@ ast en@@ ou@@ gh so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her@@ , she could coll@@ ec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the pag@@ e.
And other tim@@ es she w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't be f@@ ast en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , so sh@@ e@@ '@@ d be r@@ un@@ ning and r@@ un@@ n@@ ing, and she w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't get to the h@@ ou@@ se and the po@@ e@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would continu@@ e on ac@@ ros@@ s the l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e, loo@@ k@@ ing, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these tim@@ es -- this is the pi@@ ece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ent@@ s where she would al@@ most mis@@ s it, ri@@ ght@@ ?
So, sh@@ e's r@@ un@@ ning to the h@@ ou@@ se and sh@@ e's looking for the pa@@ per and the po@@ e@@ m pas@@ se@@ s through her@@ , and she gra@@ b@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it's going through her@@ , and then she said, it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other h@@ and and she would cat@@ ch it.
S@@ he would cat@@ ch the po@@ e@@ m by its ta@@ il@@ , and she would pul@@ l it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was tr@@ an@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the pag@@ e.
And in these in@@ st@@ anc@@ es, the po@@ e@@ m would come up on the p@@ age per@@ f@@ ec@@ t and int@@ ac@@ t but bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s, from the last wor@@ d to the fir@@ st@@ .
So when I hear@@ d that I was like -- that's un@@ can@@ n@@ y, that's ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what my cre@@ ative proc@@ ess is lik@@ e.
That's not at all what my cre@@ ative proc@@ ess is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ in@@ e@@ !
I'm a m@@ ul@@ e, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every da@@ y, and s@@ we@@ at and l@@ ab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ l@@ y.
But even I@@ , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ n@@ es@@ s, even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up again@@ st that thing@@ , at tim@@ es.
And I would imag@@ ine that a lot of you have to@@ o.
You know, even I have had work or ide@@ as come through me from a s@@ our@@ ce that I h@@ on@@ est@@ ly can@@ not id@@ enti@@ f@@ y.
And what is that thing@@ ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lo@@ se our min@@ d@@ s, b@@ ut@@ , in fac@@ t, might actually ke@@ ep us s@@ an@@ e?
And for me, the b@@ est cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary ex@@ amp@@ le that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ o@@ m W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w se@@ ver@@ al years ag@@ o on a mag@@ az@@ ine as@@ sign@@ ment@@ .
And we were tal@@ king about this, and you know, T@@ om@@ , for most of his lif@@ e, he was pre@@ tt@@ y much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary mo@@ der@@ n arti@@ st@@ , trying to contro@@ l and man@@ age and do@@ min@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able cre@@ ative im@@ pul@@ se@@ s that were t@@ ot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ ali@@ z@@ ed.
But then he got ol@@ der@@ , he got cal@@ mer@@ , and one day he was d@@ riv@@ ing down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es, and this is when it all chang@@ ed for h@@ im@@ .
And h@@ e's spe@@ ed@@ ing al@@ on@@ g@@ , and all of a su@@ d@@ de@@ n he hear@@ s this little f@@ rag@@ ment of me@@ lo@@ d@@ y, that comes into his he@@ ad as in@@ spi@@ r@@ ation of@@ t@@ en com@@ es, el@@ u@@ si@@ ve and t@@ ant@@ ali@@ z@@ ing, and he want@@ s it, it's g@@ org@@ e@@ ou@@ s, and he lon@@ g@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a pi@@ ece of pa@@ per@@ , or a pen@@ ci@@ l@@ , or a t@@ ap@@ e re@@ cor@@ der@@ .
So he star@@ ts to fe@@ el all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to ri@@ se in hi@@ m lik@@ e, "@@ I'm going to lo@@ se this thing@@ , and I'll be be h@@ a@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g for@@ ever@@ .
I'm not good en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , and I can't do it@@ ."
And in@@ ste@@ ad of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just st@@ op@@ pe@@ d.
He just st@@ op@@ p@@ ed that whole ment@@ al proc@@ ess and he did something complet@@ ely nov@@ el@@ .
He just loo@@ ked up at the s@@ k@@ y, and he said, "@@ E@@ x@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm d@@ riv@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ D@@ o I look like I can w@@ rit@@ e down a son@@ g right no@@ w@@ ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist@@ , come back at a more op@@ port@@ un@@ e mom@@ ent when I can take c@@ are of you.
O@@ ther@@ w@@ is@@ e, go bo@@ ther some@@ body el@@ se to@@ da@@ y.
G@@ o bo@@ ther L@@ e@@ on@@ ard C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ ."
And his whole work proc@@ ess chang@@ ed after that.
No@@ t the wor@@ k, the work was still of@@ t@@ ent@@ im@@ es as dar@@ k as ever@@ .
But the proc@@ es@@ s, and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was re@@ le@@ as@@ ed when he to@@ ok the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of hi@@ m where it was caus@@ ing no@@ thing but tro@@ u@@ bl@@ e, and re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it back where it came fro@@ m@@ , and re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed that this didn't have to be this inter@@ n@@ ali@@ z@@ ed, tor@@ ment@@ ed thing.
It could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar@@ , won@@ d@@ ro@@ us@@ , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re coll@@ abor@@ ation, kind of con@@ vers@@ ation between T@@ o@@ m and the str@@ ang@@ e, ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not qu@@ ite T@@ om@@ .
When I hear@@ d that stor@@ y, it started to sh@@ if@@ t a little bit the way that I wor@@ ked to@@ o, and this idea al@@ read@@ y s@@ av@@ ed me on@@ c@@ e.
It s@@ av@@ ed me when I was in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of w@@ rit@@ ing "@@ E@@ at@@ , P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ ov@@ e@@ ," and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of de@@ sp@@ ai@@ r that we all f@@ all into when we're wor@@ king on something and it's not com@@ ing and you start to think this is going to be a di@@ sa@@ st@@ er, the wor@@ st bo@@ ok ever w@@ rit@@ ten@@ .
No@@ t just b@@ ad@@ , but the wor@@ st bo@@ ok ever w@@ rit@@ ten@@ .
And I started to think I should just du@@ m@@ p this projec@@ t.
But then I rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed T@@ o@@ m tal@@ king to the o@@ pe@@ n ai@@ r and I tri@@ ed it.
So I just lif@@ ted my fac@@ e up from the man@@ us@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ t and I dire@@ c@@ ted my com@@ ment@@ s to an em@@ pt@@ y cor@@ n@@ er of the ro@@ om@@ .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you@@ , thing@@ , you and I bot@@ h know that if this bo@@ ok is@@ n't bri@@ ll@@ i@@ ant that is not enti@@ re@@ ly my fa@@ ul@@ t, ri@@ ght@@ ?
Because you can see that I am p@@ ut@@ ting every@@ thing I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be bet@@ ter@@ , you@@ 've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.
But if you don't do that, you know wh@@ at@@ , the h@@ ell with it.
I'm going to ke@@ ep w@@ rit@@ ing any@@ way because that's my j@@ ob@@ .
And I would pl@@ e@@ ase like the re@@ cor@@ d to re@@ fl@@ ec@@ t to@@ day that I show@@ ed up for my part of the j@@ ob@@ ." Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ag@@ o in the de@@ ser@@ ts of N@@ or@@ th Afric@@ a, people used to g@@ a@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ li@@ ght d@@ anc@@ es of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and mu@@ si@@ c that would go on for h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l da@@ wn@@ .
They were always ma@@ gn@@ ific@@ ent@@ , because the d@@ an@@ cer@@ s were prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ fic@@ , ri@@ ght@@ ?
But every on@@ ce in a wh@@ il@@ e, very r@@ ar@@ el@@ y, something would happen@@ , and one of these per@@ for@@ mer@@ s would actually be@@ come tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end@@ ent@@ .
And I know you know what I'm tal@@ king ab@@ ou@@ t, because I know you@@ 've all se@@ en, at some po@@ int in your lif@@ e, a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this.
It was like time would st@@ op@@ , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of port@@ al and he was@@ n't doing any@@ thing different than he had ever don@@ e, 1@@ ,000 ni@@ gh@@ ts befor@@ e, but every@@ thing would ali@@ gn@@ .
And all of a su@@ d@@ den@@ , he would no lon@@ g@@ er ap@@ pe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely hu@@ man@@ .
He would be li@@ t from wi@@ thin@@ , and li@@ t from be@@ low and all li@@ t up on fi@@ re with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity.
And when this happen@@ ed, back th@@ en, people k@@ new it for what it was@@ , you know, they called it by its nam@@ e.
They would put their h@@ and@@ s tog@@ ether and they would start to ch@@ ant@@ , "@@ All@@ a@@ h, All@@ a@@ h, All@@ a@@ h, Go@@ d, Go@@ d, Go@@ d@@ ."
That's Go@@ d, you know@@ .
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous h@@ ist@@ or@@ ical fo@@ ot@@ no@@ te@@ : when the M@@ o@@ or@@ s inv@@ a@@ ded s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, they to@@ ok this cu@@ st@@ o@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chang@@ ed over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es from "@@ All@@ a@@ h, All@@ a@@ h, All@@ a@@ h@@ ," to "@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ ," which you still he@@ ar in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ gh@@ ts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o d@@ anc@@ es.
In S@@ pa@@ in, when a per@@ form@@ er has d@@ one something im@@ possi@@ ble and mag@@ ic@@ , "@@ All@@ a@@ h, ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , All@@ a@@ h, ma@@ gn@@ ific@@ ent@@ , br@@ av@@ o@@ ," in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ bl@@ e, there it is -- a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at@@ , because we need that.
B@@ ut@@ , the tr@@ ick@@ y bit comes the next mor@@ n@@ ing, for the d@@ anc@@ er h@@ im@@ self@@ , when he wa@@ kes up and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ , and h@@ e's no lon@@ g@@ er a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se of Go@@ d.
H@@ e's just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really b@@ ad k@@ ne@@ es, and ma@@ ybe h@@ e's never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ i@@ ght again@@ .
And ma@@ ybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant Go@@ d@@ 's n@@ ame ag@@ a@@ in as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the re@@ st of his li@@ fe@@ ?
This is har@@ d.
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative lif@@ e.
But ma@@ ybe it doesn't have to be qu@@ ite so ful@@ l of an@@ gu@@ is@@ h if you never happen@@ ed to beli@@ ev@@ e, in the first plac@@ e, that the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of your being came from you.
But ma@@ ybe if you just beli@@ ev@@ ed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able s@@ our@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be pass@@ ed al@@ ong when you're fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ed, with some@@ body el@@ s@@ e.
An@@ d, you know, if we think about it this way, it star@@ ts to change every@@ thing.
This is how I've started to thin@@ k, and this is cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly how I've been thin@@ king in the last few mon@@ th@@ s as I've been wor@@ king on the bo@@ ok that will so@@ on be pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed, as the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous@@ ly, fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly over@@ -@@ ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ated fo@@ ll@@ ow up to my fre@@ ak@@ is@@ h succ@@ ess@@ .
And what I have to sort of ke@@ ep t@@ ell@@ ing m@@ y@@ sel@@ f when I get really p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ed out about that is don't be af@@ ra@@ i@@ d.
D@@ on@@ 't be da@@ un@@ t@@ ed. J@@ ust do your j@@ ob@@ .
Con@@ t@@ in@@ ue to show up for your pi@@ ece of it, wh@@ at@@ ever that might b@@ e.
If your jo@@ b is to d@@ anc@@ e, do your d@@ anc@@ e.

J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !
You know, I've tal@@ ked about some of these projec@@ ts befor@@ e -- about the human gen@@ om@@ e and what that might mean@@ , and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing new s@@ et@@ s of gen@@ es.
We@@ 're actually star@@ ting at a new po@@ int@@ : we've been di@@ g@@ iti@@ z@@ ing bi@@ olog@@ y, and now we're trying to go from that di@@ g@@ it@@ al co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of bi@@ olog@@ y with design@@ ing and sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ z@@ ing lif@@ e.
So, we've always been trying to as@@ k big question@@ s.
"@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?" is something that I think many bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st@@ s have been trying to underst@@ and at v@@ ari@@ ous l@@ ev@@ el@@ s.
We@@ 've tri@@ ed v@@ ari@@ ous ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ i@@ ma@@ l comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s.
We@@ 've been di@@ g@@ iti@@ z@@ ing it now for al@@ most 20 year@@ s@@ ;
when we se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ olog@@ y into the di@@ g@@ it@@ al world of the comput@@ er.
Now we're trying to as@@ k, "@@ C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we cre@@ ate new life out of this di@@ g@@ it@@ al uni@@ ver@@ se@@ ?"
This is the ma@@ p of a sm@@ all org@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ , M@@ y@@ co@@ pl@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um@@ , that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ om@@ e for a speci@@ es that can self@@ -@@ re@@ plic@@ ate in the l@@ abor@@ ator@@ y,
and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ om@@ e.
We@@ 're able to kno@@ c@@ k out on the or@@ der of 100 gen@@ es out of the 5@@ 00 or so that are here.
When we look at its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic ma@@ p@@ , it's rel@@ ativ@@ ely sim@@ p@@ le com@@ par@@ ed to our@@ s --
tr@@ ust me, this is sim@@ p@@ le --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ c@@ k out one at a time, it's very un@@ lik@@ ely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a liv@@ ing cell@@ .
So we deci@@ ded the only way for@@ war@@ d was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s to as@@ k some of these most fun@@ d@@ ament@@ al question@@ s.
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of@@ : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
C@@ an ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y per@@ mi@@ t ma@@ king these really lar@@ ge mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es where we've never been befor@@ e?
And if we do, can we bo@@ o@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e, by the way, is just a pi@@ ece of in@@ er@@ t ch@@ em@@ ical materi@@ al.
So, our p@@ ace of di@@ g@@ iti@@ z@@ ing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ex@@ p@@ on@@ enti@@ al p@@ ac@@ e.
O@@ u@@ r abilit@@ y to w@@ rit@@ e the gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de has been mov@@ ing pre@@ tt@@ y s@@ low@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing,
and our lat@@ est po@@ int would put it on, no@@ w, an ex@@ p@@ on@@ enti@@ al cur@@ v@@ e.
We started this over 1@@ 5 years ag@@ o.
It to@@ ok se@@ ver@@ al st@@ ag@@ es, in fac@@ t, star@@ ting with a bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ical re@@ vi@@ e@@ w befor@@ e we did the first ex@@ per@@ iment@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ z@@ ing D@@ N@@ A is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t.
There are ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es around the world that make sm@@ all pi@@ ec@@ es of D@@ N@@ A -- 3@@ 0 to 50 let@@ ter@@ s in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate proc@@ es@@ s, so the lon@@ g@@ er you make the pi@@ ec@@ e, the more er@@ r@@ or@@ s there are.
So we had to cre@@ ate a new me@@ th@@ od for p@@ ut@@ ting these little pi@@ ec@@ es tog@@ ether and cor@@ re@@ c@@ t all the er@@ r@@ or@@ s.
And this was our first att@@ em@@ p@@ t, star@@ ting with the di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation of the gen@@ om@@ e of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
It's a sm@@ all vir@@ us that ki@@ ll@@ s bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We design@@ ed the pi@@ ec@@ es, went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ re@@ c@@ tion and had a D@@ N@@ A mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s.
The ex@@ cit@@ ing ph@@ ase came when we to@@ ok this pi@@ ece of in@@ er@@ t ch@@ em@@ ical and put it in the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, and the bac@@ ter@@ ia started to re@@ ad this gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de, made the vi@@ ral partic@@ l@@ es.
The vi@@ ral partic@@ les then were re@@ le@@ as@@ ed from the cell@@ s and came back and ki@@ ll@@ ed the E@@ . co@@ li.
I was tal@@ king to the o@@ il indu@@ str@@ y re@@ cent@@ ly and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly underst@@ ood that mo@@ de@@ l@@ .
They l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed more than you gu@@ ys are.
And so, we think this is a s@@ itu@@ ation where the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can actually buil@@ d its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a bi@@ olog@@ ical system@@ .
But we wanted to go much lar@@ g@@ er@@ :
we wanted to buil@@ d the enti@@ re bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some --
it's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de --
so we thought we@@ '@@ d buil@@ d them in c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es the si@@ ze of the vir@@ us@@ es so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es to underst@@ and what the actu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s of a liv@@ ing c@@ ell are.
D@@ es@@ ig@@ n is c@@ rit@@ ic@@ al, and if you're star@@ ting with di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation in the comput@@ er, that di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ form@@ ation has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate.
When we first se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ om@@ e in 19@@ 9@@ 5@@ , the st@@ and@@ ard of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 1@@ 0@@ ,000 bas@@ e p@@ air@@ s.
We actually f@@ oun@@ d, on re@@ se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ing it, 3@@ 0 er@@ r@@ or@@ s@@ ; had we used that ori@@ gin@@ al se@@ qu@@ enc@@ e, it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up@@ .
P@@ ar@@ t of the design is design@@ ing pi@@ ec@@ es that are 50 let@@ ter@@ s long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ etter pi@@ ec@@ es to buil@@ d sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
We design uni@@ que el@@ ement@@ s into this.
You may have re@@ ad that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in.
Th@@ in@@ k of th@@ is@@ : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ l@@ etter gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de -- A@@ , C@@ , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ et@@ s of those let@@ ter@@ s co@@ de for rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ ino ac@@ id@@ s, su@@ ch that there's a sing@@ le l@@ etter design@@ ation for each of the am@@ ino ac@@ id@@ s.
So we can use the gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de to w@@ rit@@ e out wor@@ d@@ s, s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, thou@@ ght@@ s.
In@@ iti@@ ally, all we did was aut@@ ogra@@ p@@ h it.
S@@ om@@ e people were dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ed there was not po@@ et@@ r@@ y.
We design@@ ed these pi@@ ec@@ es so we can just ch@@ e@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es@@ ;
there are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pai@@ r them and put them tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
And we started ma@@ king pi@@ ec@@ es, star@@ ting with pi@@ ec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s, put those tog@@ ether to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ etter pi@@ ec@@ es, then put s@@ et@@ s of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
A@@ t each st@@ ag@@ e, we gre@@ w up these pi@@ ec@@ es in ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance so we could se@@ qu@@ ence them because we're trying to cre@@ ate a proc@@ ess that's ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a min@@ ut@@ e.
We@@ 're trying to get to the po@@ int of aut@@ om@@ ation.
So, this loo@@ ks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ off@@ .
When we get into these really lar@@ ge pi@@ ec@@ es over 1@@ 00@@ ,000 bas@@ e p@@ air@@ s, they won@@ 't any lon@@ g@@ er gro@@ w re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . co@@ li --
it ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ s all the mo@@ der@@ n to@@ ol@@ s of mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ olog@@ y --
and so we tur@@ ned to other me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We k@@ new there's a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ b@@ in@@ ation that bi@@ olog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ pai@@ r D@@ N@@ A that can put pi@@ ec@@ es tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
H@@ ere's an ex@@ amp@@ le of it@@ :
there's an org@@ an@@ is@@ m called D@@ e@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cu@@ s ra@@ di@@ o@@ dur@@ an@@ s that can take three mill@@ ions ra@@ ds of ra@@ di@@ ation.
You can see in the to@@ p pan@@ el@@ , its ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some just get@@ s blo@@ wn a@@ par@@ t.
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve to 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s lat@@ er, it put it back tog@@ ether ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly as it was befor@@ e.
We have thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of org@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s that can do this.
Th@@ ese org@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s can be t@@ ot@@ ally de@@ sic@@ cat@@ ed@@ ;
they can li@@ ve in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um@@ .
I am ab@@ solut@@ ely cer@@ ta@@ in that life can ex@@ is@@ t in ou@@ ter sp@@ ac@@ e, mo@@ ve ar@@ oun@@ d, find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ .
In fac@@ t, N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sh@@ own a lot of this is out there.
H@@ ere's an actu@@ al m@@ ic@@ ro@@ gra@@ p@@ h of the mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we buil@@ t us@@ ing these proc@@ ess@@ es, actually just us@@ ing ye@@ ast me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s with the right design of the pi@@ ec@@ es we put them in@@ ;
ye@@ ast p@@ ut@@ s them tog@@ ether aut@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
This is not an el@@ ec@@ tro@@ n m@@ ic@@ ro@@ gra@@ ph@@ ; this is just a reg@@ ul@@ ar ph@@ ot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ gra@@ ph@@ .
It's su@@ ch a lar@@ ge mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we can see it with a li@@ ght m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sco@@ p@@ e.
Th@@ ese are pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ secon@@ d peri@@ o@@ d.
So, this is the pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ or@@ t wh@@ ile ag@@ o.
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de@@ ;
it's the lar@@ g@@ est mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ever made by hu@@ man@@ s of a defin@@ ed struc@@ tu@@ re.
It's over 3@@ 00 million mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar we@@ i@@ gh@@ t.
If we pr@@ int@@ ed it out at a 10 fon@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing, it ta@@ kes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pag@@ es just to pr@@ int this gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de.
Well, how do we bo@@ o@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate th@@ is@@ ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, with a vir@@ us it's pre@@ tt@@ y sim@@ pl@@ e@@ ;
it's much more com@@ plic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
It's also sim@@ pl@@ er when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ : you can just po@@ p out the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us and po@@ p in another one, and that's what you@@ 've all hear@@ d about with c@@ lon@@ ing.
W@@ it@@ h bac@@ ter@@ ia and A@@ r@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a, the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell, but we re@@ cent@@ ly show@@ ed that we can do a compl@@ ete trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one c@@ ell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it.
We pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al speci@@ es --
rou@@ gh@@ ly, these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tra gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ec@@ t for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e,
we di@@ g@@ est@@ ed it with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the pro@@ te@@ in@@ s,
and it was pre@@ tt@@ y st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the c@@ ell -- and you@@ 'll ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate our very sop@@ h@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ s here. The new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some went into the cell@@ .
In fac@@ t, we thought this might be as far as it w@@ ent@@ , but we tri@@ ed to design the proc@@ ess a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther@@ .
This is a ma@@ j@@ or me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m of evol@@ u@@ tion right here.
We find all kin@@ ds of speci@@ es that have ta@@ k@@ en up a secon@@ d ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some or a th@@ ir@@ d one from some@@ wh@@ ere, ad@@ ding thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of new tra@@ its in a secon@@ d to that speci@@ es.
So, people who think of evol@@ u@@ tion as just one gen@@ e chang@@ ing at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of bi@@ olog@@ y.
There are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es called re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually di@@ g@@ est D@@ N@@ A@@ .
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some that was in the c@@ ell doesn't have on@@ e@@ ;
the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some we put in do@@ es.
It got ex@@ pres@@ s@@ ed and it re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ z@@ ed the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some as for@@ e@@ ig@@ n materi@@ al, ch@@ e@@ w@@ ed it up@@ , and so we en@@ ded up just with a c@@ ell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ e.
It tur@@ ned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it.
And with a very sh@@ or@@ t peri@@ od of time, all the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic@@ s of one speci@@ es were lo@@ st and it con@@ ver@@ ted t@@ ot@@ ally into the new speci@@ es bas@@ ed on the new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we put in the cell@@ .
A@@ ll the pro@@ te@@ in@@ s chang@@ ed, the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es chang@@ ed@@ ; when we re@@ ad the gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de, it's ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.
So, this may so@@ un@@ d like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ em@@ y, but we can@@ , by mov@@ ing the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are of D@@ N@@ A ar@@ oun@@ d, change things qu@@ ite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
Now I've ar@@ gu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is buil@@ ding on three and a h@@ al@@ f bi@@ ll@@ ion years of evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ . And I've ar@@ gu@@ ed that we're about to per@@ hap@@ s cre@@ ate a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ amb@@ ri@@ an ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion@@ , where there's mas@@ si@@ ve new speci@@ ation bas@@ ed on this di@@ g@@ it@@ al design@@ .
Wh@@ y do th@@ is@@ ?
I think this is pre@@ tt@@ y ob@@ vi@@ ous in ter@@ m@@ s of some of the ne@@ ed@@ s.
We@@ 're about to go from si@@ x and a h@@ al@@ f to n@@ ine bi@@ ll@@ ion people over the next 4@@ 0 year@@ s.
T@@ o put it in cont@@ ex@@ t for m@@ y@@ self@@ : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
There are now three people on the plan@@ et for every one of us that ex@@ ist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; with@@ in 4@@ 0 year@@ s, ther@@ e@@ 'll be f@@ our@@ .
We have tro@@ u@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing, pro@@ vi@@ ding fre@@ sh@@ , c@@ le@@ an wat@@ er, med@@ ic@@ in@@ es, fu@@ el for the si@@ x and a h@@ al@@ f bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ .
It's going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ in@@ e.
We use over fi@@ ve bi@@ ll@@ ion t@@ on@@ s of co@@ al, 3@@ 0 bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ -@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il --
that's a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d million bar@@ rel@@ s a da@@ y.
When we try to think of bi@@ olog@@ ical proc@@ es@@ se@@ s or any proc@@ ess to re@@ pl@@ ace that, it's going to be a hu@@ ge ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
Th@@ en of cour@@ se, there's all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this materi@@ al that end@@ s up in the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ here.
We no@@ w, from our dis@@ co@@ very around the worl@@ d, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s of the fut@@ u@@ re.
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s indu@@ str@@ y only had a do@@ z@@ en or so comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s, and look at the divers@@ ity that came out of that.
We@@ 're lim@@ it@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ il@@ y by a bi@@ olog@@ ical re@@ al@@ ity and our imag@@ in@@ ation.
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es, because of these ra@@ pi@@ d me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is, to do what we're call@@ ing com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
We have the abilit@@ y now to buil@@ d a lar@@ ge ro@@ bo@@ t that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es a da@@ y.
When you think of proc@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze proc@@ es@@ se@@ s to produc@@ e oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or to produc@@ e ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ic@@ al@@ s, new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es, we can just with a sm@@ all te@@ am@@ , do more mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ olog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ enc@@ e.
And it's just st@@ and@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion@@ :
we can sel@@ ec@@ t for vi@@ abilit@@ y, ch@@ em@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion@@ , v@@ acc@@ ine produc@@ tion@@ , et@@ c@@ .
This is a sc@@ re@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sh@@ o@@ t of some tr@@ ue design so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we're wor@@ king on to actually be able to si@@ t down and design speci@@ es in the comput@@ er.
You know, we don't know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y what it@@ 'll look lik@@ e:
we know ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly what their gen@@ et@@ ic co@@ de loo@@ ks lik@@ e.
We@@ 're f@@ oc@@ us@@ ing on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s.
Y@@ ou@@ 've se@@ en re@@ cent@@ ly, cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l is just a b@@ ad ex@@ per@@ iment@@ .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s that will be com@@ ing out rel@@ ativ@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ g@@ ar@@ , to much hi@@ gh@@ er@@ -@@ val@@ ue fu@@ el@@ s like oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the only way we think that bi@@ olog@@ y can have a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ ac@@ t with@@ out f@@ ur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the cos@@ t of f@@ ood and lim@@ it@@ ing its av@@ a@@ il@@ abilit@@ y is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k, and so we're wor@@ king with design@@ ing cell@@ s to go down this ro@@ ad@@ . And we think we@@ 'll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s in about 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ s.
S@@ un@@ li@@ ght and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ... but in our dis@@ co@@ very around the worl@@ d, we have all kin@@ ds of other me@@ th@@ o@@ d@@ s.
This is an org@@ an@@ is@@ m we de@@ scri@@ b@@ ed in 19@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It liv@@ es in the de@@ ep oce@@ an, about a mi@@ le and a h@@ al@@ f de@@ ep@@ , al@@ most at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ wat@@ er tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re@@ s.
It ta@@ kes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ an@@ e us@@ ing mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar h@@ y@@ d@@ ro@@ g@@ en as its ener@@ gy s@@ our@@ c@@ e.
We@@ 're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2@@ , which can ea@@ si@@ ly be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es, con@@ ver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to d@@ ri@@ ve this proc@@ ess@@ .
So, in a sh@@ or@@ t peri@@ od of time, we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the b@@ a@@ si@@ c quest@@ ion is of "@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?" We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ de@@ st go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pet@@ ro@@ l@@ -@@ ch@@ em@@ ical indu@@ str@@ y --
Y@@ ea@@ h@@ . If you can't do that at TE@@ D@@ , where can you@@ ? --
be@@ come a ma@@ j@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of ener@@ gy ...
But al@@ so, we're now wor@@ king on us@@ ing these same to@@ ol@@ s to come up with in@@ st@@ ant s@@ et@@ s of v@@ acc@@ in@@ es.
Y@@ ou@@ 've se@@ en this ye@@ ar with f@@ lu@@ ; we're always a ye@@ ar be@@ h@@ in@@ d and a doll@@ ar sh@@ or@@ t when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ in@@ e.
I think that can be chang@@ ed by buil@@ ding com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ acc@@ in@@ es in ad@@ v@@ anc@@ e.
H@@ ere's what the fut@@ ure may be@@ g@@ in to look like with chang@@ ing, no@@ w, the evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ ary tre@@ e, spe@@ ed@@ ing up evol@@ u@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ th@@ et@@ ic bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, A@@ r@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a and, ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally, e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es.
We@@ 're a ways a@@ way from im@@ prov@@ ing peopl@@ e:
our go@@ al is just to make su@@ re that we have a ch@@ ance to sur@@ vi@@ ve long en@@ ou@@ gh to ma@@ ybe do that. Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
What I'm going to show you fir@@ st@@ , as qu@@ ick@@ ly as I can@@ , is some f@@ oun@@ d@@ ational wor@@ k, some new technolo@@ gy that we b@@ rou@@ ght to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft as part of an acqu@@ is@@ iti@@ on al@@ most ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly a ye@@ ar ag@@ o. This is S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on, and it's an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment
in which you can ei@@ ther lo@@ c@@ ally or re@@ mo@@ t@@ ely inter@@ ac@@ t with v@@ ast am@@ oun@@ ts of vi@@ su@@ al dat@@ a.
We@@ 're looking at man@@ y, many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ t@@ es of di@@ g@@ it@@ al ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and continu@@ ous@@ ly z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in, p@@ ann@@ ing through it, re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it in any way we want@@ .
And it doesn't m@@ att@@ er how much in@@ form@@ ation we're looking at@@ , how big these coll@@ ec@@ tion@@ s are or how big the imag@@ es are.
M@@ os@@ t of them are ordin@@ ary di@@ g@@ it@@ al cam@@ era ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s, but this one, for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, is a s@@ can from the L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gre@@ s@@ s, and it's in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ a@@ pi@@ x@@ el r@@ ang@@ e.
It doesn't make any differ@@ ence because the only thing that ou@@ ght to li@@ mi@@ t the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a sy@@ ste@@ m like this one is the num@@ ber of pi@@ x@@ el@@ s on your sc@@ re@@ en at any gi@@ v@@ en mom@@ ent@@ . It's also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble archit@@ ec@@ tu@@ re.
This is an enti@@ re bo@@ o@@ k, so this is an ex@@ amp@@ le of n@@ on@@ -@@ imag@@ e dat@@ a.
This is "@@ B@@ le@@ a@@ k H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s. E@@ very co@@ lu@@ m@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter@@ .
T@@ o pro@@ ve to you that it's really t@@ ex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real re@@ present@@ ation of the t@@ ex@@ t@@ ; it's not a pic@@ tu@@ re.
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ fic@@ i@@ al way to re@@ ad an e-@@ bo@@ o@@ k.
I w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't re@@ com@@ men@@ d it.
This is a more re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic cas@@ e, an is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
E@@ very lar@@ ge imag@@ e is the be@@ gin@@ ning of a se@@ c@@ tion@@ .
And this really gi@@ ves you the jo@@ y and the good ex@@ peri@@ ence of read@@ ing the real pa@@ per ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ , which is an in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly m@@ ulti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of medi@@ um@@ .
We@@ 've d@@ one something with the cor@@ n@@ er of this partic@@ ul@@ ar is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an@@ .
We@@ 've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very hi@@ gh re@@ sol@@ u@@ tion -- much hi@@ gh@@ er than in an ordin@@ ary ad -- and we've em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tra cont@@ ent@@ .
If you want to see the fe@@ atu@@ re@@ s of this car@@ , you can see it here.
O@@ r other mo@@ de@@ l@@ s, or even tech@@ n@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ation@@ s.
And this really get@@ s at some of these ide@@ as about really doing a@@ way with those lim@@ its on sc@@ re@@ en real est@@ ate.
We h@@ op@@ e that this mean@@ s no more po@@ p@@ -@@ up@@ s and other ru@@ b@@ bi@@ s@@ h like that -- sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't be nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ f cour@@ se, ma@@ pp@@ ing is one of those ob@@ vi@@ ous ap@@ plic@@ ations for a technolo@@ gy like this.
And this one I really won@@ 't spen@@ d any time on, ex@@ ce@@ p@@ t to say that we have things to cont@@ ri@@ b@@ ute to this fi@@ el@@ d as w@@ ell@@ .
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . super@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on to@@ p of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ p@@ ati@@ al imag@@ e.
So let@@ 's pul@@ l up@@ , no@@ w, something el@@ s@@ e.
This is actually li@@ ve on the We@@ b no@@ w@@ ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it ou@@ t.
This is a projec@@ t called P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technolo@@ gi@@ es.
O@@ ne of them is S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful comput@@ er@@ -@@ vi@@ sion re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch d@@ one by No@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ av@@ el@@ y, a gra@@ du@@ ate stud@@ ent at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ ad@@ vi@@ s@@ ed by S@@ te@@ ve S@@ e@@ it@@ z at U@@ .@@ W@@ . and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ z@@ e@@ li@@ s@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ . A very n@@ ice coll@@ abor@@ ation.
And so this is li@@ ve on the We@@ b@@ . It's pow@@ er@@ ed by S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vi@@ e@@ w@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through imag@@ es and have this kind of m@@ ulti@@ -@@ re@@ sol@@ u@@ tion ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ r@@ ang@@ em@@ ent of the imag@@ es here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful@@ .
The computer vi@@ sion al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m@@ s have re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed these imag@@ es tog@@ ether so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real sp@@ ace in which these sh@@ ot@@ s -- all ta@@ k@@ en ne@@ ar G@@ r@@ as@@ si L@@ a@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es -- all these sh@@ ot@@ s were ta@@ k@@ en@@ . So you see el@@ ement@@ s here of st@@ abi@@ li@@ z@@ ed s@@ li@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ all@@ y.
I'm not su@@ re if I have time to show you any other en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ s.
S@@ om@@ e are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.
I would like to j@@ um@@ p stra@@ i@@ ght to one of No@@ a@@ h@@ 's ori@@ gin@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ et@@ s -- this is from an ear@@ ly pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e that we first got wor@@ king this su@@ m@@ m@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch l@@ ine be@@ h@@ in@@ d the P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technolo@@ g@@ y, It's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y so ap@@ par@@ ent from looking at the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ s we've put up on the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e.
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on.
This is a re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was d@@ one enti@@ re@@ ly comput@@ ation@@ ally from imag@@ es sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ l@@ ick@@ r@@ . You just t@@ y@@ p@@ e N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ l@@ ick@@ r@@ , and you get some pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s of gu@@ ys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t@@ s, and of the cam@@ pu@@ s and so on. And each of these or@@ ang@@ e con@@ es re@@ present@@ s an imag@@ e that was dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed to b@@ el@@ ong to this mo@@ de@@ l@@ .
And so these are all F@@ l@@ ick@@ r imag@@ es, and they@@ 've all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this wa@@ y.
We can just n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate in this very sim@@ p@@ le wa@@ y.
You know, I never thought that I'@@ d end up wor@@ king at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ f@@ t.
It's very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of re@@ ce@@ p@@ tion here.
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lo@@ ts of different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of cam@@ er@@ as@@ : it's every@@ thing from cell@@ -@@ ph@@ one cam@@ er@@ as to prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s, qu@@ ite a lar@@ ge num@@ ber of them@@ , st@@ it@@ ch@@ ed tog@@ ether in this en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ir@@ d on@@ es --
So many of them are oc@@ c@@ lu@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.
S@@ om@@ e@@ where in here there is actually a seri@@ es of ph@@ otogra@@ ph@@ s -- here we g@@ o.
This is actually a post@@ er of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed cor@@ re@@ c@@ t@@ l@@ y.
We can di@@ ve in from the post@@ er to a ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical vi@@ e@@ w of this en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ .
What the po@@ int here really is is that we can do things with the soci@@ al en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ . This is now ta@@ king d@@ ata from every@@ body -- from the enti@@ re coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve mem@@ or@@ y, vi@@ su@@ ally, of what the E@@ ar@@ th loo@@ ks like -- and lin@@ k all of that tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
Th@@ ose ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s be@@ come lin@@ k@@ ed, and they make something em@@ er@@ g@@ ent that's gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s.
You have a mo@@ del that em@@ er@@ g@@ es of the enti@@ re E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al E@@ ar@@ th wor@@ k.
And this is something that gro@@ w@@ s in compl@@ ex@@ ity as people use it, and wh@@ ose ben@@ e@@ f@@ its be@@ come gre@@ at@@ er to the us@@ ers as they use it.
Th@@ e@@ ir own ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s are gett@@ ing t@@ ag@@ g@@ ed with met@@ a@@ -@@ d@@ ata that some@@ body el@@ se ent@@ er@@ ed.
If some@@ body bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ int@@ s and say who they all are, then my ph@@ o@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ d@@ ral su@@ d@@ den@@ ly get@@ s en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed with all of that dat@@ a, and I can use it as an ent@@ ry po@@ int to di@@ ve into that sp@@ ac@@ e, into that met@@ a@@ -@@ vers@@ e, us@@ ing every@@ body el@@ se@@ 's ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s, and do a kind of a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ dal and c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er soci@@ al ex@@ peri@@ ence that wa@@ y.
And of cour@@ se, a b@@ y@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ se@@ ly ric@@ h vir@@ tu@@ al mo@@ de@@ l@@ s of every interest@@ ing part of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ , coll@@ ec@@ ted not just from over@@ he@@ ad f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts and from s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite imag@@ es and so on, but from the coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve mem@@ or@@ y.
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : D@@ o I underst@@ and this ri@@ ght@@ ? What your so@@ f@@ tw@@ are is going to al@@ lo@@ w, is that at some po@@ int@@ , really with@@ in the next few year@@ s, all the pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s that are sh@@ ar@@ ed by any@@ one ac@@ ros@@ s the world are going to lin@@ k tog@@ e@@ ther@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A@@ : Y@@ es. What this is really doing is dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing,
cre@@ ating h@@ y@@ per@@ lin@@ k@@ s, if you wi@@ ll@@ , between imag@@ es.
It's doing that bas@@ ed on the cont@@ ent insi@@ de the imag@@ es.
And that get@@ s really ex@@ cit@@ ing when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess of the sem@@ anti@@ c in@@ form@@ ation a lot of imag@@ es hav@@ e.
L@@ i@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for imag@@ es, you t@@ y@@ p@@ e in ph@@ r@@ as@@ es, and the t@@ ex@@ t on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of in@@ form@@ ation about what that pic@@ ture is of@@ .
What if that pic@@ ture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s@@ ?
The am@@ oun@@ t of sem@@ anti@@ c inter@@ con@@ nec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ n@@ ess that comes out of that is really hu@@ g@@ e.
It's a c@@ las@@ si@@ c net@@ work eff@@ ec@@ t.
C@@ A@@ : T@@ r@@ ul@@ y incredi@@ bl@@ e. Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ation@@ s.
You know, one of the int@@ en@@ se pl@@ e@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s of tr@@ av@@ el and one of the de@@ li@@ gh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch is the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to li@@ ve am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ go@@ tt@@ en the old wa@@ ys, who still fe@@ el their pas@@ t in the w@@ in@@ d, t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ on@@ es pol@@ i@@ sh@@ ed by ra@@ in, ta@@ st@@ e it in the b@@ it@@ ter le@@ av@@ es of pl@@ ant@@ s.
J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ an@@ s still j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ on@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ a@@ y, or the m@@ y@@ th@@ s of the I@@ nu@@ it el@@ der@@ s still re@@ son@@ ate with mean@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a, the B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist@@ s still p@@ ur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ at@@ h of the D@@ har@@ ma@@ , is to really rem@@ em@@ ber the cent@@ ral re@@ v@@ el@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we li@@ ve does not ex@@ is@@ t in some ab@@ solut@@ e sen@@ se, but is just one mo@@ del of re@@ al@@ it@@ y,
the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of one partic@@ ul@@ ar se@@ t of ad@@ ap@@ ti@@ ve ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age ma@@ de, al@@ be@@ it succ@@ ess@@ fu@@ ll@@ y, many gener@@ ations ag@@ o.
And of cour@@ se, we all sh@@ are the same ad@@ ap@@ ti@@ ve im@@ per@@ ativ@@ es.
We@@ 're all bor@@ n@@ . We all br@@ ing our chil@@ dre@@ n into the world.
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es.
We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ a@@ th@@ , so it sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't sur@@ pri@@ se us that we all s@@ ing, we all d@@ anc@@ e,
we all have ar@@ t.
But wh@@ at's interest@@ ing is the uni@@ que ca@@ d@@ ence of the son@@ g@@ , the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cul@@ tu@@ re.
And wh@@ ether it is the Pen@@ an in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o a@@ col@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ it@@ i, or the war@@ ri@@ or@@ s in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t de@@ ser@@ t of N@@ or@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ and@@ ero in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ s of the An@@ de@@ s, or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a --
this is inci@@ dent@@ ally the f@@ ell@@ ow that I tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed into the de@@ ser@@ t with a mon@@ th ag@@ o -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma@@ , E@@ ver@@ est@@ , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mo@@ ther of the world.
A@@ ll of these peopl@@ es te@@ ach us that there are other ways of be@@ ing, other ways of thin@@ k@@ ing, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing you@@ r@@ sel@@ f in the E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And this is an ide@@ a, if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with h@@ op@@ e.
Now, tog@@ ether the m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al life and cul@@ tu@@ ral life that en@@ velo@@ p@@ s the plan@@ et@@ , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the plan@@ et as in@@ de@@ ed is the bi@@ olog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ e.
And you might think of this cul@@ tu@@ ral we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, and you might de@@ fine the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the su@@ m t@@ ot@@ al of all thou@@ gh@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s, m@@ y@@ th@@ s, ide@@ as@@ , in@@ spi@@ r@@ ation@@ s, in@@ tu@@ it@@ ions b@@ rou@@ ght into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation sin@@ ce the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness@@ .
The e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here is hu@@ man@@ it@@ y@@ 's great leg@@ ac@@ y.
It's the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ve speci@@ es.
And just as the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ de@@ d, so to@@ o is the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here -- and, if any@@ thing@@ , at a far gre@@ at@@ er rat@@ e.
N@@ o bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st@@ s, for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, would d@@ are su@@ gg@@ est that 50 percent of all speci@@ es or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion because it sim@@ pl@@ y is not tr@@ u@@ e, and y@@ et that -- the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ c sc@@ en@@ ario in the re@@ al@@ m of bi@@ olog@@ ical divers@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ario in the re@@ al@@ m of cul@@ tu@@ ral divers@@ ity.
And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that, of cour@@ se, is lan@@ gu@@ age lo@@ s@@ s.
When each of you in this ro@@ o@@ m were bor@@ n@@ , there were 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es s@@ po@@ k@@ en on the plan@@ et@@ .
Now, a lan@@ gu@@ age is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a se@@ t of gram@@ mat@@ ical r@@ ul@@ es.
A lan@@ gu@@ age is a f@@ las@@ h of the human spi@@ rit@@ .
It's a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each partic@@ ul@@ ar cul@@ ture comes into the materi@@ al world.
E@@ very lan@@ gu@@ age is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ th for@@ est of the min@@ d, a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed, a thou@@ ght, an e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es.
And of those 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es, as we si@@ t here to@@ day in M@@ on@@ ter@@ e@@ y, fu@@ ll@@ y h@@ al@@ f are no lon@@ g@@ er being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of chil@@ d@@ ren@@ .
Th@@ ey@@ 're no lon@@ g@@ er being ta@@ u@@ ght to b@@ abi@@ es, which mean@@ s, eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y, un@@ l@@ ess something chang@@ es, they're al@@ read@@ y de@@ ad@@ .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ velo@@ p@@ ed in si@@ l@@ enc@@ e, to be the last of your people to spe@@ a@@ k your lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e, to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ do@@ m of the anc@@ est@@ or@@ s or ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mi@@ se of the chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ?
And y@@ et@@ , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ li@@ ght of some@@ body some@@ where on E@@ ar@@ th rou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ e@@ k@@ s, because every two we@@ e@@ k@@ s, some el@@ der di@@ es and car@@ ri@@ es with hi@@ m into the gr@@ ave the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e.
And I know there's some of you who say, "@@ Well, w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't it be bet@@ ter@@ ,
w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't the world be a better pl@@ ace if we all just s@@ po@@ ke one lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e@@ ?" And I say, "@@ G@@ re@@ at@@ , let@@ 's make that lan@@ gu@@ age Y@@ or@@ u@@ b@@ a. L@@ et@@ 's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.
L@@ et@@ 's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."
And you@@ 'll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly dis@@ co@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ a@@ k your own lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e.
And so, what I'@@ d like to do with you to@@ day is sort of take you on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here,
a bri@@ e@@ f j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, to try to be@@ g@@ in to give you a sen@@ se of what in fac@@ t is being lo@@ st@@ .
Now, there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing@@ ," I really do me@@ an different ways of be@@ ing.
T@@ ak@@ e, for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, this chil@@ d of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who beli@@ eve that m@@ y@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mi@@ l@@ k riv@@ er from the e@@ ast in the bell@@ y of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es.
Now, this is a people who co@@ gn@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h the colo@@ r bl@@ ue from the colo@@ r gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ en@@ s is e@@ qu@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est u@@ po@@ n which the people de@@ pen@@ d.
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous lan@@ gu@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called "@@ l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y@@ :@@ " you m@@ ust mar@@ ry some@@ one who spe@@ a@@ ks a different lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e.
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the m@@ y@@ th@@ olog@@ ical p@@ ast@@ , y@@ et the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es, where there are si@@ x or se@@ v@@ en lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es s@@ po@@ k@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ e, you never he@@ ar any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e.
They sim@@ pl@@ y li@@ st@@ en and then be@@ g@@ in to spe@@ a@@ k.
O@@ r@@ , one of the most f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever liv@@ ed with@@ , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or@@ , an ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ e@@ fu@@ ll@@ y in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7@@ , fi@@ ve mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es att@@ em@@ p@@ ted cont@@ ac@@ t and made a c@@ rit@@ ical mi@@ st@@ ak@@ e.
They d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed from the ai@@ r 8 x 10 g@@ lo@@ s@@ s@@ y ph@@ otogra@@ ph@@ s of them@@ sel@@ ves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly g@@ est@@ u@@ re@@ s, for@@ gett@@ ing that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never se@@ en any@@ thing tw@@ o@@ -@@ dimen@@ sion@@ al in their liv@@ es.
They pic@@ ked up these ph@@ otogra@@ ph@@ s from the for@@ est f@@ lo@@ or@@ , tri@@ ed to look be@@ h@@ in@@ d the fac@@ e to find the for@@ m or the fi@@ gu@@ re, f@@ ound no@@ thing@@ , and con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l@@ , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the fi@@ ve mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es to de@@ a@@ th@@ .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ der@@ s.
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other@@ .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other@@ .
We tr@@ ac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back ei@@ ght gener@@ ation@@ s, and we f@@ ound two in@@ st@@ anc@@ es of natu@@ ral de@@ at@@ h and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the f@@ ell@@ ow@@ s had go@@ tt@@ en so old that he di@@ ed gett@@ ing ol@@ d, so we spe@@ ar@@ ed hi@@ m any@@ wa@@ y. But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous know@@ l@@ ed@@ ge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing.
Th@@ e@@ ir h@@ un@@ ter@@ s could sm@@ ell ani@@ ma@@ l ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what speci@@ es le@@ ft it be@@ h@@ in@@ d.
In the ear@@ ly '@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, I had a really ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was as@@ ked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i, in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the se@@ cre@@ t societ@@ i@@ es which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er@@ 's str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ t@@ on Ma@@ co@@ ut@@ es, and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In or@@ der to make sen@@ se out of sen@@ s@@ ation, of cour@@ se, I had to underst@@ and something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ do@@ un@@ . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a bl@@ ac@@ k ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t.
O@@ n the contr@@ ar@@ y, it's a compl@@ e@@ x met@@ ap@@ h@@ y@@ s@@ ical worl@@ d@@ vi@@ e@@ w.
It's interest@@ ing.
If I as@@ ked you to n@@ ame the great re@@ li@@ g@@ ions of the worl@@ d, what would you sa@@ y@@ ?
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i@@ an@@ it@@ y, I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ , B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ m@@ , J@@ u@@ da@@ is@@ m@@ , wh@@ at@@ ever@@ .
Th@@ ere's always one contin@@ ent le@@ ft ou@@ t, the as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous beli@@ e@@ f@@ s. Well, of cour@@ se, they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is sim@@ pl@@ y the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very prof@@ ound re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous ide@@ as that came over dur@@ ing the tra@@ gi@@ c Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ lav@@ er@@ y er@@ a.
B@@ ut@@ , what ma@@ kes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interest@@ ing is that it's this liv@@ ing rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the liv@@ ing and the de@@ ad@@ .
So, the liv@@ ing give bi@@ r@@ th to the spi@@ rit@@ s.
The spi@@ rit@@ s can be in@@ vo@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ at@@ h the G@@ re@@ at W@@ at@@ er, respon@@ ding to the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ar@@ il@@ y dis@@ pl@@ ace the s@@ ou@@ l of the liv@@ ing, so that for that bri@@ e@@ f sh@@ in@@ ing mom@@ ent@@ , the a@@ col@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d.
That's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ist@@ s like to say that "@@ You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ a@@ k about Go@@ d.
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ p@@ le and be@@ come Go@@ d@@ ."
And because you are pos@@ s@@ es@@ se@@ d, you are ta@@ k@@ en by the spi@@ ri@@ t -- how can you be har@@ med@@ ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation@@ s@@ : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o a@@ col@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance h@@ and@@ l@@ ing b@@ ur@@ ning em@@ ber@@ s with im@@ pun@@ it@@ y, a ra@@ ther ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the abilit@@ y of the min@@ d to aff@@ ec@@ t the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the state of ex@@ tre@@ me ex@@ cit@@ ation.
Now, of all the peopl@@ es that I've ever been with@@ , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ i@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ a@@ da de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a.
D@@ es@@ c@@ end@@ ant@@ s of the an@@ ci@@ ent T@@ ai@@ ron@@ a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which on@@ ce car@@ pet@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ quest@@ , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an i@@ sol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ ove the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain@@ .
In a b@@ loo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed contin@@ ent@@ , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh@@ .
T@@ o this da@@ y, they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a rit@@ u@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ in@@ ing for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is ra@@ ther ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y.
The y@@ oun@@ g a@@ col@@ y@@ t@@ es are ta@@ k@@ en a@@ way from their fam@@ i@@ li@@ es at the age of three and f@@ our@@ , se@@ quest@@ er@@ ed in a sh@@ a@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ n@@ ess in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the bas@@ e of g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 year@@ s@@ :
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ ye@@ ar peri@@ o@@ ds de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely ch@@ o@@ se@@ n to mi@@ mi@@ c the n@@ ine mon@@ th@@ s of g@@ est@@ ation they spen@@ d in their natu@@ ral mo@@ ther@@ 's w@@ om@@ b@@ ; now they are met@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ically in the w@@ om@@ b of the great mo@@ ther@@ .
And for this enti@@ re time, they are inc@@ ul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ u@@ es of their societ@@ y, val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the pro@@ positi@@ on that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the cos@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical -- b@@ al@@ anc@@ e.
And at the end of this am@@ az@@ ing in@@ iti@@ ation, one day they're su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ta@@ k@@ en out and for the first time in their liv@@ es, at the age of 1@@ 8@@ , they see a s@@ un@@ ris@@ e. And in that c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al mom@@ ent of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first li@@ ght as the S@@ un be@@ gin@@ s to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e, su@@ d@@ den@@ ly every@@ thing they have lear@@ ned in the ab@@ str@@ ac@@ t is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ l@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est ste@@ p@@ s back
and sa@@ ys, "@@ You se@@ e? It's really as I've t@@ old you.
It is that be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful@@ . It is you@@ r@@ s to pro@@ tec@@ t@@ ."
They call them@@ sel@@ ves the "@@ el@@ der b@@ ro@@ ther@@ s@@ " and they say w@@ e, who are the y@@ oun@@ g@@ er b@@ ro@@ ther@@ s, are the on@@ es respon@@ si@@ ble for de@@ st@@ ro@@ ying the world.
Now, this l@@ ev@@ el of in@@ tu@@ iti@@ on be@@ comes very import@@ ant@@ .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e, we ei@@ ther in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the "@@ no@@ ble s@@ av@@ ag@@ e@@ ," which is an idea rac@@ is@@ t in its sim@@ plic@@ it@@ y, or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ativ@@ el@@ y, we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ or@@ ea@@ u and say these people are clo@@ s@@ er to the E@@ ar@@ th than we are.
Well, indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther s@@ ent@@ iment@@ al no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by nost@@ al@@ gi@@ a.
Th@@ ere's not a lot of ro@@ o@@ m for ei@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ amp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the chi@@ ll@@ ing w@@ in@@ ds of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , but they hav@@ e, ne@@ ver@@ the@@ l@@ es@@ s, through time and rit@@ u@@ al, for@@ g@@ ed a tra@@ dit@@ ion@@ al m@@ y@@ st@@ i@@ que of the E@@ ar@@ th that is bas@@ ed not on the idea of being self@@ -@@ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly clo@@ se to it, but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er in@@ tu@@ it@@ ion@@ : the idea that the E@@ ar@@ th it@@ sel@@ f can only ex@@ is@@ t because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness@@ .
Now, what does that mean@@ ?
It mean@@ s that a y@@ oun@@ g ki@@ d from the An@@ de@@ s wh@@ o@@ 's ra@@ is@@ ed to beli@@ eve that that mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is an A@@ p@@ u spi@@ ri@@ t that will dire@@ c@@ t his or her de@@ st@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to that re@@ s@@ our@@ ce or that pl@@ ace than a y@@ oun@@ g ki@@ d from M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to beli@@ eve that a mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is a pi@@ le of ro@@ c@@ k read@@ y to be min@@ ed.
Wh@@ ether it's the ab@@ o@@ de of a spi@@ ri@@ t or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant@@ .
Wh@@ at's interest@@ ing is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the indi@@ vidu@@ al and the natu@@ ral world.
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ rit@@ is@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to beli@@ eve those for@@ est@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ed to be c@@ ut@@ .
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ end@@ s am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who beli@@ eve that those for@@ est@@ s were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ a@@ k of H@@ e@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ rit@@ s that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the worl@@ d, spi@@ rit@@ s they would have to eng@@ age dur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation.
Now, if you be@@ g@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s could cre@@ ate different re@@ al@@ iti@@ es, you could be@@ g@@ in to underst@@ and some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary dis@@ co@@ ver@@ i@@ es. T@@ a@@ ke this pl@@ ant here.
It's a ph@@ otogra@@ p@@ h I to@@ ok in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l@@ .
This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca@@ , which many of you have hear@@ d ab@@ ou@@ t, the most pow@@ er@@ ful p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.
What ma@@ kes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ colo@@ g@@ ical pot@@ enti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation, but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different s@@ our@@ c@@ es@@ :
on the one h@@ and, this w@@ oo@@ d@@ y li@@ an@@ a which has in it a seri@@ es of bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ mal@@ in@@ e, mi@@ l@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ og@@ en@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is ra@@ ther to have sort of bl@@ ue h@@ az@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke d@@ ri@@ ft ac@@ ros@@ s your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess -- but it's mi@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ av@@ es of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e fam@@ il@@ y called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ di@@ s.
This pl@@ ant had in it some very pow@@ er@@ ful tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es, very clo@@ se to bra@@ in ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in, di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e, 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e.
If you@@ 've ever se@@ en the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i b@@ low@@ ing that s@@ nu@@ f@@ f up their no@@ s@@ es, that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different se@@ t of speci@@ es also cont@@ ain@@ s me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e.
T@@ o have that pow@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is ra@@ ther like being sh@@ o@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ int@@ ing@@ s and l@@ and@@ ing on a se@@ a of el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity. It doesn't cre@@ ate the di@@ stor@@ tion of re@@ al@@ it@@ y@@ ; it cre@@ at@@ es the dis@@ sol@@ u@@ tion of re@@ al@@ ity.
In fac@@ t, I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or@@ , R@@ ich@@ ard E@@ v@@ an S@@ h@@ ul@@ t@@ es -- who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e@@ de@@ li@@ c era with his dis@@ co@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s --
I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you coul@@ dn't c@@ las@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ og@@ en@@ ic because by the time you're un@@ der the eff@@ ec@@ ts there's no one hom@@ e any@@ more to ex@@ peri@@ ence a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es is they can@@ not be ta@@ k@@ en or@@ ally because they're den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me f@@ ound natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ id@@ as@@ e.
They can only be ta@@ k@@ en or@@ ally if ta@@ k@@ en in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other ch@@ em@@ ical that den@@ atu@@ re@@ s the M@@ A@@ O@@ .
Now, the f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es f@@ ound with@@ in that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ or@@ s of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e. So you as@@ k you@@ r@@ sel@@ f a question@@ . H@@ o@@ w, in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 speci@@ es of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar pl@@ ant@@ s, do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated pl@@ ant@@ s that when com@@ b@@ in@@ ed in this way, cre@@ ated a kind of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s@@ ?
Well, we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ is@@ m@@ , "@@ tri@@ al and er@@ r@@ or@@ ," which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be mean@@ ing@@ l@@ ess@@ .
But you as@@ k the Indi@@ an@@ s, and they say, "@@ The pl@@ ant@@ s talk to us@@ ."
Well, what does that mean@@ ?
This tri@@ b@@ e, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 v@@ ari@@ et@@ i@@ es of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca@@ , all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h a great dist@@ ance in the for@@ est@@ , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one speci@@ es.
And then you as@@ k them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say, "@@ I thought you k@@ new something about pl@@ ant@@ s. I mean@@ , don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."
Well, it tur@@ n@@ s out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ari@@ et@@ i@@ es in the ni@@ ght of a ful@@ l mo@@ on, and it sing@@ s to you in a different ke@@ y.
Now, that's not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interest@@ ing than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ en@@ s.
Now -- -- the prob@@ le@@ m -- the prob@@ le@@ m is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ et@@ ic with the p@@ li@@ ght of indi@@ gen@@ ous people vi@@ e@@ w them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ gin@@ s of h@@ ist@@ or@@ y as the real worl@@ d, mean@@ ing our worl@@ d, mo@@ ves on.
Well, the tr@@ ut@@ h is the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y, 3@@ 00 years from no@@ w, is not going to be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolo@@ g@@ ical in@@ nov@@ ation@@ s, but ra@@ ther as the era in which we st@@ ood by and ei@@ ther ac@@ tiv@@ ely end@@ or@@ s@@ ed or pas@@ si@@ v@@ ely acc@@ ep@@ ted the mas@@ si@@ ve de@@ struc@@ tion of bot@@ h bi@@ olog@@ ical and cul@@ tu@@ ral divers@@ ity on the plan@@ et@@ . Now, the prob@@ le@@ m is@@ n't chang@@ e.
A@@ ll cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es of lif@@ e.
And the prob@@ le@@ m is not technolo@@ gy it@@ self@@ .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ an@@ s did not st@@ o@@ p being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they g@@ ave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ ro@@ w any more than an Americ@@ an st@@ op@@ p@@ ed being an Americ@@ an when he g@@ ave up the h@@ or@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y.
It's not change or technolo@@ gy that thre@@ at@@ en@@ s the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is pow@@ er,
the c@@ ru@@ de fac@@ e of do@@ min@@ ation.
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the worl@@ d, you dis@@ co@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s de@@ st@@ in@@ ed to f@@ ad@@ e a@@ wa@@ y@@ ;
these are d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic liv@@ ing peopl@@ es being d@@ riv@@ en out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by id@@ enti@@ fi@@ able for@@ c@@ es that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to@@ :
wh@@ ether it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an --
a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a, from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who liv@@ ed fre@@ e in the for@@ est un@@ ti@@ l a gener@@ ation ag@@ o, and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to ser@@ vit@@ u@@ de and pro@@ st@@ itu@@ tion on the b@@ an@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the riv@@ er it@@ sel@@ f is so@@ il@@ ed with the si@@ l@@ t that se@@ em@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying h@@ al@@ f of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o a@@ way to the S@@ ou@@ th Ch@@ ina S@@ e@@ a, where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ i@@ gh@@ ter@@ s h@@ an@@ g li@@ ght in the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on
read@@ y to f@@ ill their h@@ ol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ g@@ s ri@@ pp@@ ed from the for@@ est --
or@@ , in the cas@@ e of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i, it's the di@@ se@@ ase ent@@ iti@@ es that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the dis@@ co@@ very of g@@ ol@@ d.
O@@ r if we go into the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ s of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , where I'm doing a lot of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch re@@ cent@@ ly, you@@ 'll see it's a c@@ ru@@ de fac@@ e of polit@@ ical do@@ min@@ ation.
You know, gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de, the ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de, the de@@ struc@@ tion of peopl@@ e's way of lif@@ e, is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, it's univers@@ ally, in many qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s, c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated as part of a develo@@ p@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y.
And you can@@ not underst@@ and the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t un@@ ti@@ l you mo@@ ve through it at the gro@@ un@@ d l@@ ev@@ el@@ .
I on@@ ce tr@@ av@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 mi@@ les from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ est@@ er@@ n Ch@@ ina over@@ l@@ and through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a y@@ oun@@ g coll@@ e@@ ag@@ u@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I underst@@ ood the fac@@ e be@@ h@@ in@@ d the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ s you he@@ ar ab@@ out@@ :
6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ment@@ s tor@@ n a@@ part to d@@ ust and as@@ h@@ es,
1@@ .@@ 2 million people ki@@ ll@@ ed by the ca@@ dre@@ s dur@@ ing the C@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral R@@ evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ .
This y@@ oun@@ g man@@ 's fa@@ ther had been as@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a.
That me@@ ant he was in@@ st@@ ant@@ ly ki@@ ll@@ ed at the time of the Ch@@ in@@ ese inv@@ a@@ sion@@ .
H@@ is un@@ c@@ le fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that to@@ ok the people to Ne@@ p@@ al.
H@@ is mo@@ ther was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the c@@ ri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y.
He was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ l@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ at@@ h her s@@ k@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she coul@@ dn't be@@ ar to be with@@ out h@@ im@@ .
The sist@@ er who had d@@ one that br@@ ave de@@ ed was put into an ed@@ uc@@ ation cam@@ p@@ .
O@@ ne day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ent@@ ly ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gre@@ s@@ sion@@ , she was gi@@ v@@ en se@@ v@@ en years of h@@ ard l@@ abor@@ .
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possi@@ ble to be@@ ar@@ , but the re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ ti@@ ve spi@@ ri@@ t of the people is something to be@@ h@@ ol@@ d.
And in the en@@ d, th@@ en, it really comes down to a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e:
do we want to li@@ ve in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ ati@@ c world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ ati@@ c world of divers@@ it@@ y@@ ?
Mar@@ g@@ ar@@ et M@@ e@@ ad@@ , the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ st@@ , said, befor@@ e she di@@ ed, that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted to@@ war@@ ds this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gen@@ eri@@ c world vi@@ e@@ w not only would we see the enti@@ re r@@ ang@@ e of the human imag@@ in@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w mo@@ d@@ al@@ ity of thou@@ ght, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day hav@@ ing for@@ go@@ tt@@ en there were even other possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es.
And it's hu@@ m@@ bl@@ ing to rem@@ em@@ ber that our speci@@ es h@@ as@@ , per@@ hap@@ s, been around for [@@ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ] year@@ s.
The Ne@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic R@@ evol@@ u@@ tion -- which g@@ ave us ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, at which time we su@@ c@@ cu@@ m@@ b@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ; we cre@@ ated hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ ali@@ z@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 1@@ 0@@ ,000 years ag@@ o.
The mo@@ der@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years ol@@ d.
Now, that sh@@ al@@ low h@@ ist@@ or@@ y doesn't su@@ gg@@ est to me that we have all the ans@@ w@@ ers for all of the ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es that will con@@ fron@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ ni@@ a.
When these m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s of the world are as@@ ked the mean@@ ing of being hu@@ man@@ , they respon@@ d with 1@@ 0@@ ,000 different vo@@ ic@@ es.
And it's with@@ in that son@@ g that we will all re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver the possibi@@ lit@@ y of being what we are@@ : a fu@@ ll@@ y con@@ sci@@ ous speci@@ es, fu@@ ll@@ y a@@ w@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peopl@@ es and all g@@ ar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ . And there are great mom@@ ent@@ s of op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sm@@ .
This is a ph@@ otogra@@ p@@ h I to@@ ok at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in I@@ s@@ l@@ and when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some I@@ nu@@ it peopl@@ e, and this man@@ , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k, t@@ old me a mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous stor@@ y of his grand@@ fa@@ ther@@ .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment has not always been kind to the I@@ nu@@ it peopl@@ e, and dur@@ ing the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s, to est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ t@@ y, we for@@ c@@ ed them into s@@ ett@@ l@@ ement@@ s.
This old man@@ 's grand@@ fa@@ ther re@@ f@@ used to g@@ o.
The fam@@ il@@ y, f@@ ear@@ ful for his lif@@ e, to@@ ok a@@ way all of his we@@ ap@@ on@@ s, all of his to@@ ol@@ s.
Now, you m@@ ust underst@@ and that the I@@ nu@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d@@ ; they to@@ ok ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age of it.
The r@@ un@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ l@@ ed@@ s were ori@@ gin@@ ally made of fi@@ s@@ h w@@ ra@@ pp@@ ed in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou h@@ ide@@ .
So, this man@@ 's grand@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by the A@@ r@@ c@@ ti@@ c ni@@ ght or the b@@ li@@ zz@@ ard that was b@@ low@@ ing.
He sim@@ pl@@ y s@@ li@@ pp@@ ed out@@ si@@ de, pu@@ ll@@ ed down his se@@ al@@ s@@ k@@ in tro@@ us@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his h@@ and@@ . And as the f@@ ec@@ es be@@ g@@ an to fre@@ e@@ z@@ e, he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the for@@ m of a bl@@ a@@ de.
He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ f@@ e and as it fin@@ ally fro@@ ze sol@@ i@@ d, he b@@ ut@@ ch@@ er@@ ed a do@@ g with it.
He s@@ kin@@ ned the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vi@@ s@@ ed a har@@ n@@ es@@ s, to@@ ok the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vi@@ s@@ ed a s@@ l@@ ed, har@@ ness@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g@@ , and dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed over the ice f@@ lo@@ es, sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ f@@ e in b@@ el@@ t.
Talk about gett@@ ing by with no@@ thing. And this, in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence of the I@@ nu@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world.
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment in A@@ pri@@ l of 19@@ 9@@ 9 g@@ ave back to t@@ ot@@ al contro@@ l of the I@@ nu@@ it an are@@ a of l@@ and lar@@ g@@ er than C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .

And fin@@ ally, in the en@@ d, I think it's pre@@ tt@@ y ob@@ vi@@ ous at le@@ ast to all of all us wh@@ o@@ 've tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et@@ , to re@@ ali@@ ze that they're not re@@ mo@@ te at all@@ .
Th@@ ey@@ 're hom@@ el@@ and@@ s of some@@ bod@@ y.
They re@@ pres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ch@@ es of the human imag@@ in@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time. And for all of us@@ , the dre@@ am@@ s of these chil@@ d@@ ren@@ , like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own chil@@ d@@ ren@@ , be@@ come part of the n@@ a@@ ked ge@@ ogra@@ ph@@ y of h@@ op@@ e.
So, what we're trying to do at the N@@ ational G@@ e@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ic@@ , fin@@ ally, is, we beli@@ eve that polit@@ ici@@ an@@ s will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ s@@ h any@@ thing.
We think that pol@@ em@@ ic@@ s --
-- we think that pol@@ em@@ ic@@ s are not per@@ su@@ a@@ si@@ v@@ e, but we think that stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ing can change the worl@@ d, and so we are prob@@ ably the b@@ est stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ing in@@ st@@ itu@@ tion in the world. We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite every mon@@ th@@ .
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tele@@ vi@@ sion ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l@@ .
O@@ u@@ r mag@@ az@@ in@@ es are re@@ ad by mill@@ ion@@ s.
And what we're doing is a seri@@ es of j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here where we're going to take our au@@ di@@ ence to plac@@ es of su@@ ch cul@@ tu@@ ral won@@ der that they can@@ not hel@@ p but come a@@ way da@@ zz@@ l@@ ed by what they have se@@ en, and h@@ o@@ pe@@ fu@@ ll@@ y, ther@@ e@@ for@@ e, em@@ br@@ ace gra@@ du@@ ally, one by one, the cent@@ ral re@@ v@@ el@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y@@ : that this world de@@ serv@@ es to ex@@ is@@ t in a diver@@ se way, that we can find a way to li@@ ve in a tr@@ ul@@ y m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the w@@ is@@ do@@ m of all peopl@@ es can cont@@ ri@@ b@@ ute to our coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I'm going to talk to you about some stu@@ f@@ f that's in this bo@@ ok of min@@ e that I h@@ op@@ e will re@@ son@@ ate with other things you@@ 've al@@ read@@ y hear@@ d, and I'll try to make some con@@ nec@@ tion@@ s m@@ y@@ self@@ , in cas@@ e you mis@@ s@@ ed them.
But I want to start with what I call the "@@ off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of wh@@ at@@ ?
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all W@@ est@@ er@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al societ@@ i@@ es. And the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ un@@ s like th@@ is@@ : if we are interest@@ ed in ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ z@@ ing the w@@ el@@ fare of our c@@ iti@@ z@@ en@@ s, the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze indi@@ vidu@@ al fre@@ e@@ do@@ m@@ .
The reas@@ on for this is bot@@ h that fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is in and of it@@ sel@@ f go@@ o@@ d, val@@ u@@ ab@@ le, wor@@ th@@ wh@@ il@@ e, ess@@ enti@@ al to being hu@@ man@@ .
And because if people have fre@@ e@@ do@@ m@@ , then each of us can ac@@ t on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze our w@@ el@@ far@@ e, and no one has to deci@@ de on our be@@ h@@ al@@ f@@ .
The way to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
The more ch@@ o@@ ice people hav@@ e, the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they hav@@ e, and the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they hav@@ e, the more w@@ el@@ fare they hav@@ e.
Th@@ is, I thin@@ k, is so de@@ e@@ pl@@ y em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the wat@@ er sup@@ pl@@ y that it w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't occu@@ r to any@@ one to quest@@ ion it.
And it's also de@@ e@@ pl@@ y em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our liv@@ es.
I'll give you some ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of what mo@@ der@@ n pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s has made possi@@ ble for us@@ .
This is my super@@ mark@@ et@@ . No@@ t su@@ ch a big one.
I want to say just a wor@@ d about sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ s@@ ing.
1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sing@@ s in my super@@ mark@@ et@@ , if you don't coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in ol@@ i@@ ve o@@ il@@ s and 1@@ 2 b@@ al@@ s@@ am@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ar@@ s you could bu@@ y to make a very lar@@ ge num@@ ber of your own sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ ch@@ ance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you.
So this is what the super@@ mark@@ et is lik@@ e.
And then you go to the con@@ su@@ m@@ er el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s st@@ ore to se@@ t up a st@@ ere@@ o sy@@ ste@@ m -- spe@@ ak@@ er@@ s, C@@ D pla@@ y@@ er, t@@ ap@@ e pla@@ y@@ er, t@@ un@@ er, amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er --
and in this one sing@@ le con@@ su@@ m@@ er el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s stor@@ e, there are that many st@@ ere@@ o system@@ s.
We can con@@ struc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ million different st@@ ere@@ o system@@ s out of the comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e.
Y@@ ou@@ 've got to ad@@ mi@@ t that's a lot of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
In other do@@ ma@@ in@@ s -- the world of commun@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
There was a time, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tele@@ ph@@ one serv@@ ice you want@@ ed, as long as it came from Ma B@@ ell@@ .
You r@@ ent@@ ed your ph@@ one. You didn't bu@@ y it.
O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that, by the way, is that the ph@@ one never b@@ ro@@ k@@ e.
And those da@@ ys are g@@ one.
We now have an al@@ most un@@ lim@@ it@@ ed v@@ ari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ on@@ es, es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ es.
Th@@ ese are c@@ ell ph@@ on@@ es of the fut@@ u@@ re.
M@@ y f@@ av@@ or@@ ite is the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er, no@@ se h@@ ai@@ r tri@@ m@@ mer@@ , and c@@ r@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch@@ .
And if by some ch@@ ance you hav@@ en@@ 't se@@ en that in your st@@ ore y@@ et@@ , you can re@@ st as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you wi@@ ll@@ .
And what this does is it le@@ ad@@ s people to w@@ alk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this question@@ . And do you know what the ans@@ w@@ er to this quest@@ ion now is@@ ? The ans@@ w@@ er is "@@ no@@ ."
It is not possi@@ ble to bu@@ y a c@@ ell ph@@ one that doesn't do to@@ o mu@@ ch@@ .
So, in other as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of life that are much more sign@@ ific@@ ant than bu@@ ying thing@@ s, the same ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion of ch@@ o@@ ice is tr@@ u@@ e.
H@@ e@@ alt@@ h car@@ e. It is no lon@@ g@@ er the cas@@ e in the Un@@ it@@ ed St@@ at@@ es that you go to the do@@ c@@ tor@@ , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or t@@ ell@@ s you what to do.
In@@ ste@@ ad@@ , you go to the do@@ c@@ tor@@ , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or t@@ ell@@ s you@@ , "@@ Well, we could do A@@ , or we could do B@@ . A has these ben@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s. B has these ben@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s. What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c sa@@ ys, "@@ A has these ben@@ e@@ f@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s, and B has these ben@@ e@@ f@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s.
What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c sa@@ ys, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ."
And the re@@ sul@@ t is -- we call it "@@ p@@ ati@@ ent aut@@ on@@ om@@ y@@ ," which ma@@ kes it so@@ un@@ d like a good thing@@ ,
but it really is a sh@@ if@@ ting of the b@@ ur@@ de@@ n and the respon@@ si@@ bilit@@ y for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ ma@@ king from some@@ body who know@@ s something -- nam@@ el@@ y, the do@@ c@@ t@@ or -- to some@@ body who know@@ s no@@ thing and is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly sic@@ k and th@@ us not in the b@@ est sh@@ ap@@ e to be ma@@ king deci@@ sion@@ s -- nam@@ el@@ y, the p@@ ati@@ ent@@ .
Th@@ ere's en@@ or@@ m@@ ous mark@@ et@@ ing of pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion d@@ ru@@ g@@ s to people like you and me, wh@@ ich@@ , if you think about it, ma@@ kes no sen@@ se at all@@ , sin@@ ce we can't bu@@ y them.
Wh@@ y do they mark@@ et to us if we can't bu@@ y them@@ ?
The ans@@ w@@ er is that they ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t us to call our do@@ c@@ tor@@ s the next mor@@ ning and as@@ k for our pre@@ script@@ ions to be chang@@ ed.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing as d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c as our i@@ dent@@ ity has now be@@ come a m@@ att@@ er of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, as this s@@ li@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate. We don't in@@ her@@ it an i@@ dent@@ it@@ y@@ ; we get to inv@@ ent it.
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent our@@ sel@@ ves as of@@ t@@ en as we lik@@ e.
And that mean@@ s that every da@@ y, when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ n@@ ing, you have to deci@@ de what kind of per@@ son you want to b@@ e.
W@@ it@@ h re@@ spe@@ c@@ t to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ il@@ y, there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion that al@@ most every@@ one had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you coul@@ d, and then you started hav@@ ing ki@@ ds as so@@ on as you coul@@ d.
The only real ch@@ o@@ ice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter@@ .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys, every@@ thing is very much up for gra@@ b@@ s.
I te@@ ach won@@ der@@ fu@@ ll@@ y intell@@ ig@@ ent stu@@ dent@@ s, and I as@@ si@@ gn 20 percent l@@ ess work than I used to.
And it's not because they're l@@ ess s@@ mar@@ t, and it's not because they're l@@ ess di@@ li@@ g@@ ent@@ .
It's because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed, as@@ king them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, "@@ S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or not@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed no@@ w@@ ?
S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed lat@@ er@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I have ki@@ ds fir@@ st@@ , or a car@@ e@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?"
A@@ ll of these are con@@ su@@ m@@ ing question@@ s.
And they're going to ans@@ w@@ er these question@@ s, wh@@ ether or not it mean@@ s not doing all the work I as@@ si@@ gn and not gett@@ ing a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.
And in@@ de@@ ed they sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d. Th@@ ese are important question@@ s to ans@@ w@@ er.
W@@ or@@ k -- we are bl@@ es@@ se@@ d, as C@@ ar@@ l was po@@ int@@ ing ou@@ t, with the technolo@@ gy that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ ute of every day from any pl@@ ace on the plan@@ et -- ex@@ ce@@ p@@ t the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el@@ .
There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the way, that I'm not going to tell any@@ body ab@@ ou@@ t, where the W@@ i@@ F@@ i actually wor@@ k@@ s.
I'm not t@@ ell@@ ing you about it because I want to use it.
So what this mean@@ s, this incredi@@ ble fre@@ e@@ do@@ m of ch@@ o@@ ice we have with re@@ spe@@ c@@ t to wor@@ k, is that we have to make a deci@@ sion@@ , ag@@ a@@ in and ag@@ a@@ in and again@@ , about wh@@ ether we should or sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't be wor@@ k@@ ing.
We can go to wat@@ ch our ki@@ d pla@@ y so@@ c@@ cer@@ , and we have our c@@ ell ph@@ one on one hi@@ p@@ , and our B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p@@ , and our l@@ ap@@ t@@ op@@ , pre@@ su@@ m@@ ab@@ ly, on our l@@ ap@@ s.
And even if they're all sh@@ ut off@@ , every min@@ ute that we're wat@@ ch@@ ing our ki@@ d mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ate a so@@ cc@@ er g@@ am@@ e, we are also as@@ king our@@ sel@@ v@@ es, "@@ S@@ h@@ ould I ans@@ w@@ er this c@@ ell ph@@ one call@@ ?
S@@ h@@ ould I respon@@ d to this em@@ a@@ il@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I d@@ ra@@ ft this let@@ ter@@ ?"
And even if the ans@@ w@@ er to the quest@@ ion is "@@ no@@ ," it's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly going to make the ex@@ peri@@ ence of your ki@@ d@@ 's so@@ cc@@ er g@@ ame very different than it w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ 've be@@ en@@ .
So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and sm@@ all thing@@ s, materi@@ al things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le thing@@ s, life is a m@@ att@@ er of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And the world we used to li@@ ve in loo@@ ked like this. [@@ Well, actu@@ ally, they are w@@ rit@@ t@@ en in st@@ on@@ e@@ .@@ ] That is to say, there were some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es, but not every@@ thing was a m@@ att@@ er of ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
And the world we now li@@ ve in loo@@ ks like this. [@@ The T@@ en Com@@ man@@ d@@ ment@@ s D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it@@ ] And the quest@@ ion is, is this good ne@@ w@@ s, or b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s@@ ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is, "@@ y@@ es@@ ."
We all know wh@@ at's good about it, so I'm going to talk about wh@@ at's b@@ ad about it.
A@@ ll of this ch@@ o@@ ice has two eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, two ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ec@@ ts on peopl@@ e.
O@@ ne eff@@ ec@@ t, par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ic@@ ally, is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s, ra@@ ther than li@@ ber@@ ation.
W@@ it@@ h so many op@@ tion@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m@@ , people find it very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to ch@@ oo@@ se at all@@ .
I'll give you one very d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c ex@@ amp@@ le of th@@ is@@ : a stud@@ y that was d@@ one of inv@@ est@@ ment@@ s in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ rem@@ ent plan@@ s.
A coll@@ e@@ ag@@ ue of min@@ e got acc@@ ess to inv@@ est@@ ment re@@ cor@@ ds from V@@ an@@ guar@@ d, the gi@@ g@@ anti@@ c m@@ ut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ fun@@ d comp@@ any of about a million em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ plac@@ es.
And what she f@@ ound is that for every 10 m@@ ut@@ u@@ al fun@@ ds the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed, r@@ ate of partic@@ i@@ p@@ ation went down two per@@ cent@@ .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ w@@ er em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es partic@@ i@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er fi@@ v@@ e. Wh@@ y@@ ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m@@ , it's so d@@ am@@ n h@@ ard to deci@@ de which fun@@ d to ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, that you@@ 'll just put it off un@@ ti@@ l t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w.
And then t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and of cour@@ se t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w never com@@ es.
Un@@ der@@ st@@ and that not only does this me@@ an that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g f@@ ood when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have en@@ ou@@ gh mon@@ ey put a@@ way, it also mean@@ s that ma@@ king the deci@@ sion is so h@@ ard that they pas@@ s up sign@@ ific@@ ant mat@@ ch@@ ing mon@@ ey from the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er.
B@@ y not partic@@ i@@ p@@ at@@ ing, they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a ye@@ ar from the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er, who would hap@@ pi@@ ly mat@@ ch their cont@@ ri@@ b@@ ut@@ ion@@ .
So par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of hav@@ ing to@@ o many ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es.
And I think it ma@@ kes the world look like this.
[@@ And l@@ ast@@ ly, for all et@@ er@@ n@@ it@@ y, F@@ ren@@ ch@@ , b@@ le@@ u ch@@ e@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ]
You really want to get the deci@@ sion right if it's for all et@@ er@@ n@@ it@@ y, ri@@ ght@@ ?
You don't want to pic@@ k the w@@ ron@@ g m@@ ut@@ u@@ al fun@@ d, or the w@@ ron@@ g sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ s@@ ing.
So that's one eff@@ ec@@ t. The secon@@ d eff@@ ec@@ t is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s and make a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e, we end up l@@ ess s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with the re@@ sul@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ w@@ er op@@ tion@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m@@ .
And there are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ on@@ s for this.
O@@ ne of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sing@@ s to ch@@ oo@@ se fro@@ m@@ , if you bu@@ y one, and it's not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t -- and what sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ s@@ ing is@@ ? -- it's e@@ as@@ y to imag@@ ine you could have made a different ch@@ o@@ ice that would have been bet@@ ter@@ . And what happen@@ s is this imag@@ in@@ ed al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de,
even if it was a good deci@@ sion@@ .
The more op@@ tion@@ s there are, the ea@@ si@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t any@@ thing at all that is dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ os@@ e.
S@@ econ@@ d, what econom@@ ist@@ s call "@@ op@@ port@@ un@@ ity cost@@ s@@ ."
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big po@@ int this mor@@ ning of tal@@ king about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things de@@ pen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to.
Well, when there are lo@@ ts of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der@@ , it is e@@ as@@ y to imag@@ ine the attr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve fe@@ atu@@ re@@ s of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ jec@@ t that make you l@@ ess s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that you@@ 've ch@@ os@@ en@@ .
H@@ ere's an ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e. [@@ I can't st@@ o@@ p thin@@ king about those other av@@ a@@ il@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ ry if you're not New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s.
H@@ ere's what you're sup@@ pos@@ ed to be thin@@ k@@ ing.
H@@ ere's this co@@ up@@ le on the H@@ am@@ pt@@ on@@ s.
V@@ er@@ y ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve real est@@ ate.
G@@ org@@ e@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful da@@ y. They have it all to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
What could be bet@@ ter@@ ? "@@ Well, d@@ am@@ n it@@ ," this gu@@ y is thin@@ k@@ ing,
"@@ It's A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ . E@@ ver@@ y@@ body in my M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is a@@ wa@@ y.
I could be par@@ king right in fron@@ t of my buil@@ d@@ ing@@ ."
And he spen@@ ds two we@@ e@@ ks n@@ ag@@ g@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ s@@ ing the op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ y, day after da@@ y, to have a great par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ e.
O@@ p@@ port@@ un@@ ity cost@@ s sub@@ tr@@ ac@@ t from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, even when what we ch@@ oo@@ se is ter@@ ri@@ fic@@ .
And the more op@@ tion@@ s there are to consi@@ der@@ , the more attr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve fe@@ atu@@ re@@ s of these op@@ tion@@ s are going to be re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted by us as op@@ port@@ un@@ ity cost@@ s.
H@@ ere's another ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e.
Now this car@@ to@@ on ma@@ kes a lot of po@@ int@@ s.
It ma@@ kes po@@ int@@ s about liv@@ ing in the mom@@ ent as w@@ ell, and prob@@ ably about doing things s@@ low@@ l@@ y.
But one po@@ int it ma@@ kes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing one thing@@ , you're ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have lo@@ ts of attr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve fe@@ atu@@ re@@ s, and it's going to make what you're doing l@@ ess attr@@ ac@@ tiv@@ e.
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ : es@@ cal@@ ation of ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ation@@ s.
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ pl@@ ace my j@@ e@@ an@@ s.
I we@@ ar j@@ e@@ an@@ s al@@ most all the time.
There was a time when j@@ e@@ an@@ s came in one f@@ lavor@@ , and you b@@ ou@@ ght them@@ , and they f@@ it like c@@ rap@@ , they were incredi@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ fort@@ ab@@ le, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ h@@ ed them en@@ ou@@ gh tim@@ es, they started to fe@@ el OK@@ .
I went to re@@ pl@@ ace my j@@ e@@ an@@ s after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old on@@ es, and I said, "@@ I want a pai@@ r of j@@ e@@ an@@ s. H@@ ere's my si@@ z@@ e@@ ."
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ per said, "@@ D@@ o you want s@@ li@@ m f@@ it, e@@ as@@ y f@@ it, re@@ la@@ x@@ ed f@@ it@@ ?
You want b@@ ut@@ t@@ on f@@ ly or zi@@ p@@ per fl@@ y@@ ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed@@ ?
D@@ o you want them dist@@ re@@ s@@ se@@ d@@ ?
You want bo@@ o@@ t c@@ ut@@ , ta@@ per@@ ed, bl@@ a@@ h bl@@ a@@ h@@ ." O@@ n and on he w@@ ent@@ .
M@@ y j@@ a@@ w d@@ ro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. And after I re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed, I said, "@@ I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d@@ ." He had no idea what that was@@ , so I spen@@ t an h@@ our trying on all these d@@ am@@ n j@@ e@@ an@@ s, and I w@@ al@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- tr@@ u@@ th@@ ! -- with the b@@ est@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting j@@ e@@ an@@ s I had ever h@@ ad@@ .
I did bet@@ ter@@ . A@@ ll this ch@@ o@@ ice made it possi@@ ble for me to do bet@@ ter@@ .
But -- I fel@@ t wor@@ s@@ e.
Wh@@ y@@ ? I w@@ ro@@ te a whole bo@@ ok to try to ex@@ pla@@ in this to m@@ y@@ self@@ .
The reas@@ on -- The reas@@ on I fel@@ t wor@@ se is that, with all of these op@@ tion@@ s av@@ a@@ il@@ ab@@ le, my ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ations about how good a pai@@ r of j@@ e@@ an@@ s should be went up@@ .
I had very lo@@ w, no partic@@ ul@@ ar ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one f@@ lavor@@ . When they came in 100 f@@ lavor@@ s, d@@ am@@ n it, one of them sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ 've been per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And what I got was go@@ o@@ d, but it was@@ n't per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I com@@ par@@ ed what I got to what I ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ed, and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ed.
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tion@@ s to peopl@@ e's liv@@ es can't hel@@ p but incre@@ ase the ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tion@@ s will b@@ e.
And what that's going to produc@@ e is l@@ ess s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with re@@ sul@@ t@@ s, even when they're good re@@ sul@@ t@@ s.
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ et@@ ing know@@ s this.
[@@ It all loo@@ ks so gre@@ at@@ . I can't wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ed@@ .@@ ] Because if they di@@ d, you w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't all know what this was ab@@ ou@@ t.
The tr@@ ut@@ h is more like this.
[@@ E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing was better back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se@@ ] The reas@@ on that every@@ thing was better back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se is that when every@@ thing was wor@@ se, it was actually possi@@ ble for people to have ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es that were a pl@@ e@@ as@@ ant sur@@ pri@@ s@@ e.
No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys, the world we li@@ ve in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent@@ , indu@@ stri@@ ali@@ z@@ ed c@@ iti@@ z@@ en@@ s, with per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion the ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ation -- the b@@ est you can ever h@@ op@@ e for is that stu@@ f@@ f is as good as you ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t it to b@@ e.
You will never be pl@@ e@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ed because your ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ation@@ s, my ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ation@@ s, have g@@ one through the ro@@ of@@ .
The se@@ cre@@ t to hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess -- this is what you all came for -- the se@@ cre@@ t to hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess is low ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ation@@ s. I want to say --
just a little aut@@ o@@ bi@@ ogra@@ ph@@ ical mom@@ ent -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ f@@ e, and sh@@ e's really qu@@ ite won@@ der@@ ful@@ .
I coul@@ dn't have d@@ one bet@@ ter@@ .
I didn't s@@ ett@@ le. But s@@ ett@@ l@@ ing is@@ n't always su@@ ch a b@@ ad thing.
F@@ in@@ ally -- O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pai@@ r of j@@ e@@ an@@ s when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are dis@@ s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed, and you as@@ k wh@@ y,
wh@@ o@@ 's respon@@ si@@ bl@@ e, the ans@@ w@@ er is c@@ lear@@ : the world is respon@@ si@@ bl@@ e.
What could you do@@ ?
When there are h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of j@@ e@@ an@@ s av@@ a@@ il@@ ab@@ le, and you bu@@ y one that is dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing, and you as@@ k wh@@ y, wh@@ o@@ 's respon@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ ? It is e@@ qu@@ ally c@@ le@@ ar that the ans@@ w@@ er to the quest@@ ion is "@@ you@@ ."
You could have d@@ one bet@@ ter@@ .
W@@ it@@ h a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d different kin@@ ds of j@@ e@@ an@@ s on dis@@ pla@@ y, there is no ex@@ c@@ use for fa@@ il@@ u@@ re.
And so when people make deci@@ sion@@ s, and even thou@@ gh the re@@ sul@@ ts of the deci@@ sion@@ s are go@@ o@@ d, they fe@@ el dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ed about them@@ ; they bl@@ ame them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ded in the indu@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation.
I beli@@ eve a sign@@ ific@@ ant -- not the on@@ ly, but a sign@@ ific@@ ant -- cont@@ ri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to this ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion of de@@ pres@@ sion@@ , and also su@@ ic@@ ide@@ , is that people have ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es that are dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing because their st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds are so hi@@ gh@@ ,
and then when they have to ex@@ pla@@ in these ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, they think they're at fa@@ ul@@ t.
And so the ne@@ t re@@ sul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al, ob@@ jec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y, and we fe@@ el wor@@ s@@ e.
So le@@ t me re@@ min@@ d you.
This is the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ , the one that we all take to be tr@@ u@@ e, and it's all f@@ al@@ s@@ e. It is not tr@@ u@@ e.
Th@@ ere's no quest@@ ion that some ch@@ o@@ ice is better than n@@ one, but it doesn't fo@@ ll@@ ow from that that more ch@@ o@@ ice is better than some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
Th@@ ere's some mag@@ ical am@@ oun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pre@@ tt@@ y con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent that we have long sin@@ ce pass@@ ed the po@@ int where op@@ tion@@ s im@@ pro@@ ve our w@@ el@@ far@@ e.
Now, as a pol@@ ic@@ y m@@ att@@ er -- I'm al@@ most d@@ one -- as a pol@@ ic@@ y mat@@ ter@@ , the thing to think about is th@@ is@@ :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this ch@@ o@@ ice in indu@@ stri@@ al societ@@ i@@ es is materi@@ al aff@@ lu@@ enc@@ e.
There are lo@@ ts of plac@@ es in the worl@@ d, and we have hear@@ d about se@@ ver@@ al of them@@ , where their prob@@ le@@ m is not that they have to@@ o much ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
Th@@ e@@ ir prob@@ le@@ m is that they have to@@ o lit@@ t@@ le.
So the stu@@ f@@ f I'm tal@@ king about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar prob@@ le@@ m of mo@@ der@@ n@@ , aff@@ lu@@ ent@@ , W@@ est@@ er@@ n societ@@ i@@ es.
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is th@@ is@@ : S@@ te@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you y@@ est@@ er@@ day about how these ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve and diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ all chil@@ d se@@ at@@ s don't hel@@ p@@ .
What I'm t@@ ell@@ ing you is that these ex@@ pen@@ si@@ v@@ e, com@@ plic@@ ated ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es -- it's not sim@@ pl@@ y that they don't hel@@ p@@ .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t.
They actually make us wor@@ se off@@ .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our societ@@ i@@ es to make all of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es we make were sh@@ if@@ ted to societ@@ i@@ es in which people have to@@ o few op@@ tion@@ s, not only would those peopl@@ e's liv@@ es be im@@ pro@@ ved@@ , but our@@ s would be im@@ prov@@ ed al@@ so,
which is what econom@@ ist@@ s call a "@@ P@@ ar@@ et@@ o@@ -@@ im@@ prov@@ ing mo@@ ve@@ ."
In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make every@@ one better off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this ex@@ c@@ ess ch@@ o@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ u@@ es us@@ .
So to con@@ c@@ lu@@ de. [@@ You can be any@@ thing you want to be -- no lim@@ it@@ s@@ ]
Y@@ ou@@ 're sup@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ ad this car@@ to@@ on, and, being a sop@@ h@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated person@@ , say, "@@ A@@ h@@ ! What does this fi@@ s@@ h know@@ ?
You know, no@@ thing is possi@@ ble in this fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ ."
I@@ m@@ po@@ ver@@ i@@ sh@@ ed imag@@ in@@ ation, a m@@ y@@ o@@ pi@@ c vi@@ e@@ w of the world --
and that's the way I re@@ ad it at fir@@ st@@ .
The more I thought about it, h@@ o@@ we@@ ver@@ , the more I came to the vi@@ e@@ w that this fi@@ s@@ h know@@ s some@@ thing.
Because the tr@@ ut@@ h of the m@@ att@@ er is that if you sh@@ att@@ er the fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ bl@@ e, you don't have fre@@ e@@ do@@ m@@ . You have par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s.
If you sh@@ att@@ er this fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ bl@@ e, you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion@@ .
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s, and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion@@ .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body ne@@ ed@@ s a fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ .
This one is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly to@@ o lim@@ it@@ ed -- per@@ hap@@ s even for the fi@@ sh@@ , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly for us@@ .
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for mi@@ ser@@ y, and, I s@@ us@@ pe@@ c@@ t, di@@ sa@@ st@@ er.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
