S@@ ever@@ al years ag@@ o here at TE@@ D@@ , P@@ et@@ er S@@ ki@@ ll@@ man int@@ ro@@ duc@@ ed a design ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
And the ide@@ a@@ 's pre@@ tt@@ y sim@@ pl@@ e:
T@@ e@@ am@@ s of f@@ our have to buil@@ d the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ ture out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti@@ , one y@@ ard of t@@ ap@@ e, one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on t@@ op@@ .
An@@ d, thou@@ gh it se@@ em@@ s really sim@@ pl@@ e, it's actually pre@@ tt@@ y h@@ ard because it for@@ c@@ es people to coll@@ abor@@ ate very qu@@ ick@@ l@@ y.
And so, I thought this was an interest@@ ing ide@@ a, and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ .
And it was a hu@@ ge succ@@ ess@@ .
And sin@@ ce th@@ en, I've con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s ac@@ ros@@ s the world with stu@@ dent@@ s and design@@ ers and archit@@ ec@@ t@@ s, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 5@@ 0@@ ,
and there's something about this ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep l@@ es@@ son@@ s about the natu@@ re of coll@@ abor@@ ation, and I'@@ d like to sh@@ are some of them with you.
So, nor@@ m@@ ally, most people be@@ g@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing them@@ sel@@ ves to the t@@ as@@ k.
They talk about it, they fi@@ gu@@ re out what it's going to look lik@@ e, they j@@ oc@@ k@@ ey for pow@@ er. Th@@ en they spen@@ d some time pl@@ ann@@ ing, organi@@ z@@ ing,
they s@@ k@@ et@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti@@ .
They spen@@ d the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ sem@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s. And then fin@@ ally, just as they're r@@ un@@ ning out of time, some@@ one ta@@ kes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w, and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on t@@ op@@ , and then they st@@ and bac@@ k, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! --
they ad@@ mi@@ re their wor@@ k.
But what really happen@@ s, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " tur@@ n@@ s into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ ," because the we@@ i@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low caus@@ es the enti@@ re struc@@ ture to b@@ uc@@ k@@ le and to coll@@ ap@@ s@@ e.
So there are a num@@ ber of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " mom@@ ent@@ s than other@@ s, and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are re@@ c@@ ent gra@@ du@@ at@@ es of busin@@ ess sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
They li@@ e, they ch@@ e@@ at@@ , they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produc@@ e really l@@ ame struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s.
And of cour@@ se there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s, and am@@ ong the b@@ est are re@@ c@@ ent gra@@ du@@ at@@ es of kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ .
And it's pre@@ tt@@ y am@@ az@@ ing.
A@@ s P@@ et@@ er t@@ ell@@ s us@@ , not only do they produc@@ e the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s, but they're the most interest@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s of them all@@ .
So the quest@@ ion you want to as@@ k is@@ : How com@@ e? Wh@@ y@@ ? What is it about them@@ ?
And P@@ et@@ er li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the ki@@ ds spen@@ d any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pag@@ h@@ etti@@ , In@@ c@@ . R@@ i@@ ght@@ ?
They don't spen@@ d time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for pow@@ er.
But there's another reas@@ on as w@@ ell@@ .
And the reas@@ on is that busin@@ ess stu@@ dent@@ s are tra@@ in@@ ed to find the sing@@ le right plan@@ , ri@@ ght@@ ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it.
And then what happen@@ s is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the t@@ op@@ , they r@@ un out of time and what hap@@ pens@@ ?
It's a c@@ ri@@ si@@ s.
S@@ ound fam@@ i@@ li@@ ar@@ ? R@@ i@@ gh@@ t.
What kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ent@@ ly is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w, and they buil@@ d pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es, succ@@ essi@@ ve pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es, always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on t@@ op@@ , so they have m@@ ulti@@ p@@ le tim@@ es to fi@@ x when they buil@@ d pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es al@@ ong the wa@@ y.
D@@ es@@ i@@ gn@@ ers re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ ze this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of coll@@ abor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative proc@@ ess@@ .
And with each ver@@ sion@@ , ki@@ ds get in@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn't wor@@ k.
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to pla@@ y in pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e is really ess@@ enti@@ al, but let@@ 's look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form@@ .
So the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es@@ ; busin@@ ess sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s stu@@ dent@@ s, about h@@ al@@ f of that@@ ; la@@ w@@ y@@ er@@ s, a little bet@@ ter@@ , but not much better than that, kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ er@@ s, better than most ad@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
W@@ ho does the very b@@ est@@ ?
A@@ r@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ s, th@@ an@@ k@@ fu@@ ll@@ y.
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ch@@ es is the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ ture I've se@@ en@@ .
And why is it@@ ? Because they underst@@ and tri@@ ang@@ les and self@@ -@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric@@ al p@@ atter@@ n@@ s are the k@@ ey to buil@@ ding st@@ able struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s.
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit better than aver@@ ag@@ e,
but her@@ e's where it get@@ s interest@@ ing.
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ve ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am@@ , they get sign@@ ific@@ ant@@ ly bet@@ ter@@ .
It's incredi@@ bl@@ e. You know, you look ar@@ oun@@ d, you g@@ o, "@@ O@@ h, that te@@ am@@ 's going to w@@ in@@ ." You can just tell befor@@ e@@ h@@ and@@ . And why is that@@ ?
Because they have speci@@ al s@@ ki@@ ll@@ s of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation.
They man@@ age the proc@@ es@@ s, they underst@@ and the proc@@ ess@@ .
And any te@@ am who man@@ ag@@ es and pa@@ ys clo@@ se att@@ enti@@ on to work will sign@@ ific@@ ant@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ve the te@@ am@@ 's per@@ for@@ man@@ c@@ e.
S@@ pe@@ ci@@ ali@@ z@@ ed s@@ ki@@ ll@@ s and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation s@@ ki@@ ll@@ s are the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation that le@@ ad@@ s to str@@ ong succ@@ ess@@ .
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form@@ , you@@ 'll get ma@@ ybe si@@ x or so that have st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s.
And I tri@@ ed something interest@@ ing.
I thou@@ ght, let@@ 's up the ant@@ e, on@@ c@@ e.
So I off@@ er@@ ed a 1@@ 0@@ ,000 doll@@ ar pri@@ ze of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to the w@@ in@@ ning te@@ am@@ .
So what do you think happen@@ ed to these design stu@@ dent@@ s@@ ?
What was the re@@ sul@@ t@@ ?
H@@ ere's what happen@@ ed@@ :
No@@ t one te@@ am had a st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re.
If any@@ one had buil@@ t, say, a one in@@ ch struc@@ tu@@ re, they would have ta@@ k@@ en hom@@ e the pri@@ z@@ e.
So, is@@ n't that interest@@ ing@@ ? That hi@@ gh st@@ a@@ kes have a str@@ ong imp@@ ac@@ t.
We did the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se ag@@ a@@ in with the same stu@@ dent@@ s.
What do you think happen@@ ed th@@ en@@ ?
So now they underst@@ and the val@@ ue of pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ ing.
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very b@@ est@@ .
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s in the le@@ ast am@@ oun@@ t of time.
So there's de@@ ep l@@ es@@ son@@ s for us about the natu@@ re of in@@ cent@@ i@@ ves and succ@@ ess@@ . So, you might as@@ k@@ : Wh@@ y would any@@ one actually spen@@ d time w@@ rit@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e?
And the reas@@ on is, I hel@@ p cre@@ ate di@@ g@@ it@@ al to@@ ol@@ s and proc@@ es@@ se@@ s to hel@@ p te@@ am@@ s buil@@ d car@@ s and vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and vi@@ su@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s.
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge does is it hel@@ p@@ s them id@@ enti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ d@@ de@@ n as@@ su@@ m@@ pt@@ ion@@ s.
Be@@ caus@@ e, f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly, every projec@@ t has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w, doesn't it@@ ?
The ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge pro@@ vide@@ s a sh@@ ar@@ ed ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e, a comm@@ on lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ e, a comm@@ on st@@ ance to buil@@ d the right pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e.
And so, this is the val@@ ue of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e, of this so sim@@ p@@ le ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ e.
And those of you who are interest@@ ed may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It's a blo@@ g that you can look at how to buil@@ d the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ s.
Th@@ ere's ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ ste@@ p in@@ struc@@ tion@@ s on this.
There are c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ a@@ k and ad@@ just the system@@ .
Th@@ ere's world re@@ cor@@ ds that are on this as w@@ ell@@ .
And the fun@@ d@@ ament@@ al l@@ es@@ son@@ , I beli@@ ev@@ e, is that design tr@@ ul@@ y is a cont@@ ac@@ t s@@ port@@ .
It de@@ man@@ ds that we br@@ ing all of our sen@@ se@@ s to the t@@ as@@ k, and that we ap@@ pl@@ y the very b@@ est of our thin@@ k@@ ing, our fe@@ el@@ ing and our doing to the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge that we have at h@@ and@@ .
And som@@ et@@ im@@ es, a little pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e of this ex@@ peri@@ ence is all that it ta@@ kes to tur@@ n us from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " mom@@ ent to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " mom@@ ent@@ .
And that can make a big differ@@ enc@@ e.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's pre@@ ten@@ d right here we have a ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e. A big ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e, a co@@ ol@@ , TE@@ D@@ -@@ is@@ h ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e, and it's a time ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e.
And every@@ one in this ro@@ o@@ m has to get into it.
And you can go bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s, you can go for@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ ; you can@@ not st@@ a@@ y where you are.
And I won@@ der what you@@ '@@ d ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, because I've been as@@ king my fri@@ end@@ s this quest@@ ion a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go bac@@ k.
I don't know@@ . They want to go back befor@@ e there were aut@@ om@@ o@@ bi@@ les or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ Americ@@ an I@@ d@@ ol@@ ."
I don't know@@ .
I'm con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that there's some sort of pul@@ l to nost@@ al@@ gi@@ a, to wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
And I underst@@ and that.
I'm not part of that c@@ ro@@ w@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.
I don't want to go bac@@ k, and it's not because I'm ad@@ vent@@ uro@@ us@@ . It's because possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es on this plan@@ et@@ , they don't go bac@@ k, they go for@@ war@@ d.
So I want to get in the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ e, and I want to go for@@ war@@ d.
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there's ever been on this plan@@ et by any me@@ as@@ ure that you w@@ is@@ h to ch@@ oo@@ se@@ : he@@ al@@ th@@ , we@@ al@@ th@@ , mo@@ bilit@@ y, op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ y, de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing rat@@ es of di@@ se@@ ase ...
Th@@ ere's never been a time like this.
M@@ y gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ par@@ ent@@ s di@@ ed, all of them@@ , by the time they were 6@@ 0@@ .
M@@ y grand@@ par@@ ent@@ s p@@ us@@ h@@ ed that num@@ ber to 7@@ 0@@ .
M@@ y par@@ ent@@ s are clo@@ s@@ ing in on 8@@ 0@@ .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the be@@ gin@@ ning of my de@@ at@@ h num@@ ber@@ .
But it's not even about people like us@@ , because this is a bi@@ gg@@ er de@@ al than that.
A ki@@ d bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i to@@ day can ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t to li@@ ve as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ag@@ o.
Th@@ in@@ k about that, it's an incredi@@ ble fac@@ t.
And why is it tr@@ u@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x ki@@ ll@@ ed bi@@ ll@@ ions of people on this plan@@ et@@ .
It re@@ sh@@ ap@@ ed the de@@ mo@@ gra@@ ph@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no wa@@ r ever h@@ as@@ .
It's g@@ one. It's v@@ ani@@ sh@@ ed.
We v@@ an@@ qui@@ sh@@ ed it. P@@ u@@ ff@@ .
In the ric@@ h worl@@ d, di@@ se@@ as@@ es that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed mill@@ ions of us just a gener@@ ation ag@@ o no lon@@ g@@ er ex@@ ist@@ , har@@ d@@ l@@ y.
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ i@@ a, ru@@ bell@@ a, pol@@ io ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are@@ ?
V@@ acc@@ in@@ es, mo@@ der@@ n med@@ ic@@ in@@ e, our abilit@@ y to fe@@ ed bi@@ ll@@ ions of peopl@@ e, those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ o@@ d.
And to my min@@ d, the sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ od -- trying stu@@ f@@ f ou@@ t, se@@ e@@ ing if it wor@@ k@@ s, chang@@ ing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment@@ s of hu@@ man@@ ity.
So that's the good ne@@ w@@ s.
Un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y, that's all the good ne@@ w@@ s because there are some other problem@@ s, and they@@ 've been ment@@ ion@@ ed many tim@@ es. And one of them is that de@@ sp@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment@@ s, a bi@@ ll@@ ion people go to b@@ ed h@@ un@@ gr@@ y in this world every da@@ y.
That num@@ ber@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ris@@ ing really ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful@@ .
And not only that, we've used our imag@@ in@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tras@@ h this glob@@ e.
Pot@@ able wat@@ er, ar@@ able l@@ and, ra@@ in@@ for@@ est@@ s, o@@ il@@ , g@@ as@@ : they're going a@@ way, and they're going a@@ way so@@ on, and un@@ l@@ ess we in@@ nov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ es@@ s, we're going a@@ way to@@ o.
So the quest@@ ion is@@ : C@@ an we do that@@ ? And I think we can@@ .
I think it's c@@ le@@ ar that we can make f@@ ood that will fe@@ ed bi@@ ll@@ ions of people with@@ out rap@@ ing the l@@ and that they li@@ ve on.
I think we can pow@@ er this world with ener@@ gy that doesn't also de@@ st@@ ro@@ y it.
I really do beli@@ eve that, and, no, it ain@@ 't wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
But her@@ e's the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght@@ :
We@@ 've never ne@@ e@@ ded pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s in sci@@ ence more than we need it right no@@ w. N@@ ever@@ . And we've also never been in a positi@@ on to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can to@@ da@@ y.
We@@ 're on the ver@@ ge of am@@ az@@ ing, am@@ az@@ ing ev@@ ent@@ s in many fi@@ el@@ d@@ s,
and y@@ et I actually think we@@ '@@ d have to go back h@@ un@@ dre@@ d@@ s, 3@@ 00 year@@ s, befor@@ e the E@@ n@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment@@ , to find a time when we b@@ att@@ l@@ ed pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s, when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, on more fron@@ t@@ s, than we do no@@ w.
P@@ e@@ ople w@@ ra@@ p them@@ sel@@ ves in their beli@@ e@@ f@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ ght@@ ly that you can't se@@ t them fre@@ e.
No@@ t even the tr@@ ut@@ h will se@@ t them fre@@ e.
An@@ d, li@@ st@@ en, every@@ on@@ e's ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ ion@@ ; they're even ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ ini@@ on about pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s. But you know what you're not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to@@ ?
Y@@ ou@@ 're not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to your own fac@@ t@@ s. S@@ or@@ r@@ y, you're no@@ t.
And this to@@ ok me a@@ wh@@ ile to fi@@ gu@@ re ou@@ t.
A@@ b@@ out a de@@ ca@@ de ag@@ o, I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es for The New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er. A little stor@@ y.
And I was am@@ az@@ ed to find op@@ pos@@ it@@ ion@@ : op@@ positi@@ on to what is, after all@@ , the most eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve pub@@ li@@ c he@@ alt@@ h me@@ as@@ ure in human h@@ ist@@ or@@ y.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do@@ : I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y and I mov@@ ed on.
And so@@ on after that, I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y about gen@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ oo@@ d.
S@@ ame thing@@ , only bi@@ gg@@ er.
P@@ e@@ ople were going c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
So I w@@ ro@@ te a stor@@ y about that to@@ o, and I coul@@ dn't underst@@ and why people thought this was "@@ F@@ ran@@ k@@ en@@ f@@ oo@@ d@@ s@@ ," why they thought mov@@ ing mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es around in a speci@@ fic@@ , ra@@ ther than a hap@@ h@@ az@@ ard way, was tre@@ sp@@ ass@@ ing on natu@@ re@@ 's gro@@ un@@ d.
B@@ ut@@ , you know, I do what I do. I w@@ ro@@ te the stor@@ y, I mov@@ ed on.
I mean@@ , I'm a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist@@ . We t@@ y@@ p@@ e, we fil@@ e, we go to d@@ in@@ n@@ er. It's fin@@ e.
But these stori@@ es bo@@ ther@@ ed me, and I coul@@ dn't fi@@ gu@@ re out wh@@ y, and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally I di@@ d.
And that's because those f@@ an@@ at@@ ic@@ s that were d@@ riv@@ ing me c@@ ra@@ z@@ y w@@ er@@ en@@ 't actually f@@ an@@ at@@ ic@@ s at all@@ .
They were thou@@ ght@@ ful peopl@@ e, ed@@ uc@@ ated peopl@@ e, de@@ c@@ ent peopl@@ e.
They were ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly like the people in this ro@@ om@@ .
And it just dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ed me so mu@@ ch@@ .
But then I thou@@ ght, you know, let@@ 's be h@@ on@@ est@@ . We@@ 're at a po@@ int in this world where we don't have the same rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s that we used to.
We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ent@@ l@@ y.
We talk about it in i@@ ron@@ ic ter@@ m@@ s with little qu@@ ot@@ es around it@@ : "@@ pro@@ gre@@ s@@ s@@ ." O@@ k@@ a@@ y, there are reas@@ on@@ s for that, and I think we know what those reas@@ on@@ s are.
We@@ 've lo@@ st fa@@ it@@ h in in@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ ion@@ s, in au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ y, and som@@ et@@ im@@ es in sci@@ ence it@@ self@@ , and there's no reas@@ on we sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't hav@@ e.
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will underst@@ and@@ .
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l@@ , B@@ h@@ op@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, V@@ i@@ o@@ x@@ x@@ , we@@ ap@@ on@@ s of mas@@ s de@@ struc@@ tion@@ , h@@ ang@@ ing ch@@ ad@@ s.
You know, you can ch@@ oo@@ se your li@@ st@@ .
There are question@@ s and problem@@ s with the people we used to beli@@ eve were always ri@@ ght,
so be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ al.
A@@ s@@ k question@@ s, de@@ m@@ and pro@@ of@@ , de@@ m@@ and e@@ vi@@ d@@ enc@@ e.
D@@ on@@ 't take any@@ thing for gr@@ ant@@ ed.
But her@@ e's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of@@ , you need to acc@@ ep@@ t the pro@@ of@@ , and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reas@@ on that I can say that is because we're now in an e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of fe@@ ar like one I've never se@@ en and h@@ op@@ e never to see again@@ .
A@@ b@@ out 1@@ 2 years ag@@ o, there was a stor@@ y pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed, a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble stor@@ y, that lin@@ ked the e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of au@@ ti@@ s@@ m to the me@@ as@@ l@@ es, mu@@ m@@ p@@ s and ru@@ bell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine sh@@ ot@@ .
V@@ er@@ y sc@@ ar@@ y.
T@@ on@@ s of studi@@ es were d@@ one to see if this was tr@@ u@@ e.
T@@ on@@ s of studi@@ es should have been don@@ e@@ ; it's a seri@@ ous is@@ su@@ e.
The d@@ ata came bac@@ k.
The d@@ ata came back from the Un@@ it@@ ed St@@ at@@ es, from E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ and, from S@@ w@@ ed@@ en, from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a, and it was all the s@@ am@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no con@@ nec@@ tion@@ , n@@ one at all@@ .
It doesn't mat@@ ter@@ . It doesn't m@@ att@@ er because we beli@@ eve an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es, we beli@@ eve what we se@@ e, what we think we se@@ e, what ma@@ kes us fe@@ el re@@ al.
We don't beli@@ eve a b@@ un@@ ch of do@@ cu@@ ment@@ s from a gover@@ n@@ ment off@@ ici@@ al gi@@ v@@ ing us dat@@ a, and I do underst@@ and that, I think we all do.
But you know wh@@ at@@ ?
The re@@ sul@@ t of that has been di@@ sa@@ st@@ ro@@ us@@ .
Di@@ sa@@ st@@ ro@@ us because her@@ e's a fac@@ t@@ : The Un@@ it@@ ed St@@ at@@ es is one of the only coun@@ tri@@ es in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine r@@ ate for me@@ as@@ les is going do@@ wn@@ .
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful@@ , and we should be as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of our@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
It's h@@ or@@ ri@@ bl@@ e.
What kind of a thing happen@@ ed that we could do that@@ ?
Now, I underst@@ and it. I do underst@@ and it.
Be@@ caus@@ e, did any@@ one have me@@ as@@ les her@@ e?
H@@ as one per@@ son in this au@@ di@@ ence ever se@@ en some@@ one di@@ e of me@@ as@@ l@@ es@@ ?
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't hap@@ pe@@ n very mu@@ ch@@ .
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't hap@@ pe@@ n in this coun@@ try at all@@ , but it happen@@ ed 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 tim@@ es in the world last year@@ .
That's a lot of de@@ at@@ h of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our@@ .
But sin@@ ce it didn't hap@@ pe@@ n here, we can put it out of our min@@ d@@ s, and people like J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing m@@ ess@@ ag@@ es of fe@@ ar and ill@@ it@@ er@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ form@@ s like "@@ O@@ p@@ ra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing L@@ i@@ ve@@ ."
And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k caus@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't underst@@ and that these things se@@ e@@ m the s@@ am@@ e, but they're al@@ most never the s@@ am@@ e.
And it's something we need to lear@@ n@@ , and we need to lear@@ n it really so@@ on.
This gu@@ y was a her@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.
He to@@ ok one of the wor@@ st sco@@ ur@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind a@@ way from us@@ .
N@@ o f@@ ear@@ , no ag@@ on@@ y. P@@ ol@@ io -- pu@@ ff@@ , g@@ one.
That gu@@ y in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le, not so mu@@ ch@@ .
H@@ is n@@ ame is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it.
He just develo@@ p@@ ed a ro@@ t@@ av@@ ir@@ us v@@ acc@@ ine with a b@@ un@@ ch of other peopl@@ e.
It@@ 'll s@@ ave the liv@@ es of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 ki@@ ds in the develo@@ p@@ ing world every year@@ .
P@@ re@@ tt@@ y go@@ o@@ d, ri@@ ght@@ ?
Well, it's go@@ o@@ d, ex@@ ce@@ p@@ t that P@@ au@@ l go@@ es around tal@@ king about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es and sa@@ ys how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just st@@ o@@ p the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually sa@@ ys it that wa@@ y.
So, P@@ a@@ ul@@ 's a ter@@ r@@ ori@@ st@@ .
When P@@ au@@ l spe@@ a@@ ks in a pub@@ li@@ c hear@@ ing, he can't test@@ if@@ y with@@ out ar@@ m@@ ed guard@@ s.
He get@@ s called at hom@@ e because people like to tell hi@@ m that they rem@@ em@@ ber where his ki@@ ds go to sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
And wh@@ y@@ ? Because P@@ au@@ l made a v@@ acc@@ in@@ e.
I don't need to say this, but v@@ acc@@ in@@ es are ess@@ enti@@ al.
You take them a@@ way, di@@ se@@ ase comes bac@@ k, h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.
We have me@@ as@@ les in this coun@@ try no@@ w.
And it's gett@@ ing wor@@ se, and pre@@ tt@@ y so@@ on ki@@ ds are going to di@@ e of it ag@@ a@@ in because it's just a num@@ ber@@ s g@@ am@@ e.
And they're not just going to di@@ e of me@@ as@@ l@@ es.
What about pol@@ i@@ o? L@@ et@@ 's have that. Wh@@ y not@@ ?
A coll@@ eg@@ e cl@@ ass@@ m@@ ate of min@@ e w@@ ro@@ te me a co@@ up@@ le we@@ e@@ ks ag@@ o and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent@@ .
N@@ o on@@ e's ever said that befor@@ e.
S@@ he was@@ n't going to v@@ acc@@ in@@ ate her ki@@ d again@@ st pol@@ i@@ o,
no wa@@ y.
F@@ in@@ e.
Wh@@ y@@ ? Because we don't have pol@@ i@@ o. And you know wh@@ at@@ ?
We didn't have pol@@ io in this coun@@ try y@@ est@@ er@@ da@@ y.
T@@ o@@ da@@ y, I don't know, ma@@ ybe a gu@@ y got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ag@@ o@@ s this mor@@ n@@ ing, and h@@ e's fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now h@@ e's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And h@@ e's going to l@@ and in a co@@ up@@ le of h@@ our@@ s, h@@ e's going to r@@ ent a car@@ , and h@@ e's going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach@@ , and h@@ e's going to att@@ end one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ in@@ n@@ ers t@@ on@@ i@@ gh@@ t.
And he doesn't know that h@@ e's inf@@ ec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ c di@@ se@@ as@@ e, and we don't ei@@ ther because that's the way the world wor@@ k@@ s.
That's the plan@@ et we li@@ ve on. D@@ on@@ 't pre@@ ten@@ d it is@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now, we lo@@ ve to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ sel@@ ves in li@@ es. We lo@@ ve to do it.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one take their vit@@ am@@ in@@ s this mor@@ n@@ ing@@ ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a, a little anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.
I know you did because h@@ al@@ f of Americ@@ an@@ s do every da@@ y.
They take the stu@@ ff@@ , and they take al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative med@@ ic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't m@@ att@@ er how of@@ t@@ en we find out that they're us@@ el@@ ess@@ .
The d@@ ata sa@@ ys it all the time.
They dar@@ k@@ en your ur@@ in@@ e. They al@@ most never do more than that.
It's o@@ k@@ a@@ y, you want to pa@@ y 2@@ 8 bi@@ ll@@ ion dollar@@ s for dar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e? I'm t@@ ot@@ ally with you.
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e. D@@ ar@@ k.
Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ? Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ?
Well, I think I underst@@ and, we h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g P@@ har@@ ma@@ .
We h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g G@@ over@@ n@@ ment@@ . We don't tr@@ ust the M@@ an@@ .
And we sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t@@ : O@@ u@@ r he@@ alt@@ h c@@ are sy@@ ste@@ m su@@ c@@ k@@ s.
It's c@@ ru@@ el to mill@@ ions of peopl@@ e.
It's ab@@ solut@@ ely ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly co@@ ld and s@@ ou@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ end@@ ing to those of us who can even af@@ for@@ d it.
So we r@@ un a@@ way from it, and where do we r@@ un@@ ?
We le@@ a@@ p into the ar@@ m@@ s of B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o.
That's f@@ ant@@ ast@@ ic@@ . I lo@@ ve B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o.
B@@ ut@@ , you know, it's really a seri@@ ous thing because this stu@@ f@@ f is c@@ rap@@ , and we spen@@ d bi@@ ll@@ ions of dollar@@ s on it.
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ p@@ s here.
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ g@@ o, f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a, f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ; ac@@ ai -- I don't even know what that is but we're spen@@ ding bi@@ ll@@ ions of dollar@@ s on it -- it's f@@ ra@@ u@@ d.
And you know wh@@ at@@ ? When I say this stu@@ ff@@ , people sc@@ re@@ am at me, and they say, "@@ What do you car@@ e? L@@ et people do what they want to do.
It ma@@ kes them fe@@ el go@@ o@@ d@@ ."
And you know wh@@ at@@ ? Y@@ ou@@ 're w@@ ron@@ g@@ .
Because I don't c@@ are if it's the se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S wh@@ o@@ 's sa@@ y@@ ing, "@@ H@@ m@@ m@@ , I'm not going to take the e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence of my ex@@ per@@ ts on m@@ am@@ mo@@ gram@@ s@@ ," or some can@@ c@@ er qu@@ ac@@ k who want@@ s to tre@@ at his p@@ ati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e en@@ em@@ as@@ .
When you start down the ro@@ ad where beli@@ e@@ f and ma@@ gi@@ c re@@ pl@@ ace e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence and sci@@ enc@@ e, you end up in a pl@@ ace you don't want to b@@ e.
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ ou@@ th Afric@@ a.
He ki@@ ll@@ ed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot@@ , g@@ ar@@ li@@ c and l@@ em@@ on o@@ il were much more eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral d@@ ru@@ g@@ s we know can s@@ low the cour@@ se of A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of ne@@ ed@@ l@@ ess de@@ a@@ th@@ s in a coun@@ try that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this di@@ se@@ as@@ e.
P@@ le@@ as@@ e, don't tell me there are no con@@ se@@ qu@@ enc@@ es to these thing@@ s.
There are. There always are.
Now, the most min@@ d@@ l@@ ess e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c we're in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ att@@ le between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ent@@ s of gen@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ ood and the organi@@ c el@@ it@@ e.
It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ ti@@ c de@@ b@@ ate. It has to st@@ op@@ .
It's a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ d@@ s, about met@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ s.
It's ide@@ olog@@ y, it's not sci@@ enc@@ e.
E@@ very sing@@ le thing we e@@ at@@ , every gra@@ in of ric@@ e, every s@@ pri@@ g of par@@ s@@ le@@ y, every B@@ r@@ us@@ sel@@ s s@@ pro@@ ut has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man@@ .
You know, there w@@ er@@ en@@ 't t@@ ang@@ er@@ in@@ es in the g@@ ar@@ de@@ n of E@@ den@@ .
There was@@ n't any c@@ ant@@ al@@ ou@@ p@@ e.
There w@@ er@@ en@@ 't Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s tre@@ es. We made it all@@ .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 year@@ s.
And some of it wor@@ k@@ ed, and some of it di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
We got ri@@ d of the stu@@ f@@ f that di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ ci@@ se way --
and there are ris@@ k@@ s, ab@@ solut@@ ely --
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in A into ric@@ e, and that stu@@ f@@ f can hel@@ p mill@@ ions of peopl@@ e, mill@@ ions of peopl@@ e, pro@@ long their liv@@ es.
You don't want to do that@@ ?
I have to say, I don't underst@@ and it.
We ob@@ jec@@ t to gen@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ oo@@ d.
Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ?
Well, the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly he@@ ar are@@ : T@@ o@@ o many ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ s, p@@ est@@ ic@@ ide@@ s, h@@ or@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, we don't want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing@@ , that's w@@ ron@@ g@@ .
We don't comp@@ ani@@ es p@@ at@@ ent@@ ing lif@@ e.
We don't want comp@@ ani@@ es ow@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is@@ ?
Y@@ es, you're ri@@ gh@@ t. L@@ et@@ 's fi@@ x it.
It's tr@@ u@@ e, we've got a hu@@ ge f@@ ood problem@@ , but this is@@ n't sci@@ enc@@ e.
This has no@@ thing to do with sci@@ enc@@ e.
It's la@@ w, it's mor@@ al@@ it@@ y, it's p@@ at@@ ent stu@@ ff@@ .
You know sci@@ ence is@@ n't a comp@@ an@@ y.
It's not a coun@@ tr@@ y.
It's not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it's a proc@@ ess@@ .
It's a proc@@ es@@ s, and som@@ et@@ im@@ es it wor@@ ks and som@@ et@@ im@@ es it does@@ n@@ '@@ t, but the idea that we should not al@@ low sci@@ ence to do its jo@@ b because we're af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, is really very de@@ ad@@ en@@ ing, and it's pre@@ vent@@ ing mill@@ ions of people from pro@@ sper@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to gro@@ w 7@@ 0 percent more f@@ ood than we do right no@@ w, 7@@ 0 per@@ cent@@ .
This inv@@ est@@ ment in Africa over the last 3@@ 0 year@@ s.
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful@@ . D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful@@ .
They need it, and we're not gi@@ v@@ ing it to them.
And wh@@ y@@ ? G@@ en@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ oo@@ d.
We don't want to en@@ co@@ u@@ rag@@ e people to e@@ at that ro@@ tt@@ en stu@@ ff@@ , like c@@ ass@@ ava for in@@ st@@ anc@@ e.
C@@ ass@@ av@@ a@@ 's something that h@@ al@@ f a bi@@ ll@@ ion people e@@ at@@ .
It's kind of like a pot@@ ato.
It's just a b@@ un@@ ch of cal@@ ori@@ es. It su@@ c@@ k@@ s.
It doesn't have n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent@@ s, it doesn't have pro@@ te@@ in, and sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s are en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing all of that into it right no@@ w.
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they@@ '@@ d be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d.
They w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't star@@ v@@ e, and you know wh@@ at@@ ?
That would be n@@ ic@@ e. It w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se, but it would be n@@ ic@@ e.
And all I can say about this is@@ : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it@@ ?
I mean@@ , let@@ 's as@@ k our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it@@ ?
Because we don't want to mo@@ ve gen@@ es ar@@ oun@@ d@@ ?
This is about mov@@ ing gen@@ es ar@@ oun@@ d. It's not about ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ s.
It's not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous pas@@ sion for h@@ or@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ sist@@ ence on hav@@ ing bi@@ gg@@ er f@@ oo@@ d, better f@@ oo@@ d, sing@@ ul@@ ar f@@ oo@@ d.
This is@@ n't about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es,
this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ v@@ e, and it's about time we started to underst@@ and what that me@@ ant@@ .
Be@@ caus@@ e, you know some@@ thing@@ ? If we don@@ '@@ t, if we continu@@ e to ac@@ t the way we're ac@@ t@@ ing, we're gu@@ il@@ t@@ y of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ t@@ y of@@ : hi@@ gh@@ -@@ tec@@ h col@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m@@ .
Th@@ ere's no other way to de@@ scri@@ be wh@@ at's going on here.
It's sel@@ fi@@ sh@@ , it's u@@ g@@ ly, it's ben@@ e@@ at@@ h us@@ , and we really have to st@@ o@@ p it.
So after this am@@ az@@ ing@@ ly f@@ un con@@ vers@@ ation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time ma@@ ch@@ ine and go for@@ war@@ d@@ ?"
A@@ b@@ solut@@ el@@ y. A@@ b@@ solut@@ el@@ y, I do.
It's st@@ uc@@ k in the pres@@ ent right no@@ w, but we have an am@@ az@@ ing op@@ port@@ un@@ ity.
We can se@@ t that time ma@@ ch@@ ine on any@@ thing we want@@ .
We can mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it, and we're going to mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it.
We have to have these con@@ vers@@ ations and we have to thin@@ k, but when we get in the time ma@@ ch@@ ine and we go a@@ he@@ ad@@ , we're going to be hap@@ p@@ y we do.
I know that we can@@ , and as far as I'm con@@ cer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world ne@@ ed@@ s right no@@ w.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
O@@ ne da@@ y, L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es T@@ im@@ es co@@ lu@@ m@@ n@@ is@@ t S@@ te@@ ve L@@ o@@ pe@@ z was w@@ al@@ king al@@ ong the stre@@ et@@ s of do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es when he hear@@ d be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful mus@@ ic@@ .

And I'm t@@ ell@@ ing a stor@@ y that many of you know, because St@@ ev@@ e's co@@ lu@@ m@@ n@@ s be@@ came the b@@ a@@ si@@ s for a bo@@ o@@ k, which was tur@@ ned into a mo@@ vi@@ e, with R@@ o@@ ber@@ t D@@ ow@@ ne@@ y J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as S@@ te@@ ve L@@ o@@ pe@@ z@@ , and J@@ am@@ i@@ e F@@ o@@ x@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ er@@ s, the J@@ u@@ ill@@ i@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st wh@@ ose pro@@ mis@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ or@@ t by a tra@@ gi@@ c aff@@ l@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ d s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ i@@ a.
N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed out of J@@ u@@ ill@@ i@@ ar@@ d, he su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed a compl@@ ete bre@@ ak@@ do@@ wn@@ , and 3@@ 0 years lat@@ er he was liv@@ ing hom@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ et@@ s of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow in do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es.
I en@@ co@@ u@@ rag@@ e all of you to re@@ ad St@@ ev@@ e's bo@@ ok or to wat@@ ch the mo@@ vi@@ e to underst@@ and not only the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful b@@ on@@ d that form@@ ed between these two men@@ ,
I'm J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a g@@ ame design@@ er.
I've been ma@@ king g@@ am@@ es on@@ l@@ ine now for 10 year@@ s, and my go@@ al for the next de@@ ca@@ de is to try to make it as e@@ as@@ y to s@@ ave the world in real life as it is to s@@ ave the world in on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
Now, I have a pl@@ an for this, and it ent@@ a@@ il@@ s con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing more peopl@@ e, inc@@ lu@@ ding all of you@@ , to spen@@ d more time pla@@ ying bi@@ gg@@ er and better g@@ am@@ es.
R@@ i@@ ght now we spen@@ d three bi@@ ll@@ ion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
S@@ om@@ e of you might be thin@@ k@@ ing, "@@ That's a lot of time to spen@@ d pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es.
Ma@@ ybe to@@ o much time, consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s we have to sol@@ ve in the real worl@@ d@@ ."
But actu@@ ally, ac@@ cor@@ ding to my re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re, actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tr@@ u@@ e.
Th@@ re@@ e bi@@ ll@@ ion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k is not ne@@ ar@@ ly en@@ ou@@ gh g@@ ame pla@@ y to sol@@ ve the worl@@ d@@ 's most ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.
In fac@@ t, I beli@@ eve that if we want to sur@@ vi@@ ve the next cent@@ ur@@ y on this plan@@ et@@ , we need to incre@@ ase that t@@ ot@@ al d@@ ram@@ at@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
I've c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated the t@@ ot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 bi@@ ll@@ ion h@@ our@@ s of g@@ ame pla@@ y every we@@ e@@ k.
So, that's prob@@ ably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ve ide@@ a, so I'll say it again@@ , le@@ t it sin@@ k in@@ :
If we want to sol@@ ve problem@@ s like h@@ un@@ g@@ er, po@@ ver@@ t@@ y, c@@ lim@@ ate chang@@ e, glob@@ al con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t, ob@@ es@@ it@@ y, I beli@@ eve that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es on@@ l@@ ine for at le@@ ast 2@@ 1 bi@@ ll@@ ion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k, by the end of the next de@@ ca@@ de. N@@ o. I'm seri@@ ou@@ s. I am@@ .
H@@ ere's wh@@ y. This pic@@ ture pre@@ tt@@ y much su@@ m@@ s up why I think g@@ am@@ es are so ess@@ enti@@ al to the fut@@ ure sur@@ viv@@ al of the human speci@@ es. T@@ r@@ ul@@ y.
This is a port@@ ra@@ it by ph@@ otogra@@ ph@@ er P@@ h@@ il T@@ ol@@ ed@@ ano. He wanted to cap@@ ture the em@@ o@@ tion of g@@ am@@ ing,
so he se@@ t up a cam@@ era in fron@@ t of g@@ am@@ ers wh@@ ile they were pla@@ y@@ ing.
And this is a c@@ las@@ si@@ c g@@ am@@ ing em@@ ot@@ ion@@ .
Now, if you're not a g@@ am@@ er, you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this ph@@ ot@@ o.
You prob@@ ably see the sen@@ se of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y, a little bit of f@@ ear@@ , but int@@ en@@ se con@@ cent@@ r@@ ation, de@@ ep@@ , de@@ ep fo@@ cu@@ s on t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ing a really diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t problem@@ .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er, you will no@@ tic@@ e a few nu@@ anc@@ es her@@ e: the c@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le of the ey@@ es up@@ , and around the m@@ ou@@ th is a si@@ gn of op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sm@@ ,
and the ey@@ e@@ b@@ ro@@ w@@ s up is sur@@ pri@@ s@@ e.
This is a g@@ am@@ er wh@@ o@@ 's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ ."
O@@ h, you@@ 've hear@@ d of that.
OK@@ , go@@ o@@ d, so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us@@ .
A@@ n e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y positi@@ v@@ e, you had no idea it was even possi@@ ble un@@ ti@@ l you a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ed it.
It was al@@ most be@@ y@@ on@@ d the thre@@ sh@@ old of imag@@ in@@ ation, and when you get ther@@ e, you're sh@@ oc@@ ked to dis@@ co@@ ver what you're tr@@ ul@@ y cap@@ able of@@ . That's an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
And this is the fac@@ e that we need to see on mill@@ ions of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next cent@@ ur@@ y -- the fac@@ e of some@@ one wh@@ o, again@@ st all o@@ d@@ d@@ s, is on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
Now, un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely this is more of the fac@@ e that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.
This is what I call the "@@ I'm No@@ t G@@ ood A@@ t L@@ i@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e. This is actually me ma@@ king it. C@@ an you se@@ e? Y@@ es. G@@ oo@@ d.
This is me ma@@ king the "@@ I'm No@@ t G@@ ood A@@ t L@@ i@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is a pi@@ ece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood in B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y, C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, where I did my P@@ h@@ D on why we're better in g@@ am@@ es than we are in real lif@@ e.
And this is a prob@@ le@@ m that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers hav@@ e. We fe@@ el that we are not as good in re@@ al@@ ity as we are in g@@ am@@ es.
I don't me@@ an just good as in succ@@ ess@@ ful@@ , al@@ thou@@ gh that's part of it. We do a@@ chi@@ eve more in g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s.
But I also me@@ an good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ter@@ s -- in@@ spi@@ red to coll@@ abor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate.
And when we're in g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s, I beli@@ eve that many of us be@@ come the b@@ est ver@@ sion of our@@ sel@@ ves -- the most lik@@ ely to hel@@ p at a mom@@ ent@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, the most lik@@ ely to st@@ ic@@ k with a prob@@ le@@ m as long at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again@@ .
And in real lif@@ e, when we fac@@ e fa@@ il@@ u@@ re, when we con@@ fron@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es, we of@@ t@@ en don't fe@@ el that wa@@ y. We fe@@ el over@@ com@@ e, we fe@@ el over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed, we fe@@ el an@@ x@@ i@@ ou@@ s, ma@@ ybe de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated or c@@ y@@ n@@ ic@@ al.
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s when we're pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, they just don't ex@@ is@@ t in g@@ am@@ es.
So that's what I wanted to stud@@ y when I was a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ dent@@ .
What about g@@ am@@ es ma@@ kes it im@@ possi@@ ble to fe@@ el that we can't a@@ chi@@ eve every@@ thing@@ ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s from g@@ am@@ es and ap@@ pl@@ y them to re@@ al@@ -@@ world wor@@ k@@ ?
So I loo@@ ked at g@@ am@@ es like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t, which is really the ide@@ al coll@@ abor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ v@@ ing en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ .
And I started to no@@ tic@@ e a few things that make e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s so possi@@ ble in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ d@@ s.
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es, es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t, there are lo@@ ts and lo@@ ts of different ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s who are wi@@ ll@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a worl@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ av@@ ing mis@@ sion@@ , right a@@ wa@@ y.
But not just any mis@@ sion@@ , it's a mi@@ ssi@@ on that is per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly mat@@ ch@@ ed with your cur@@ r@@ ent l@@ ev@@ el in the g@@ am@@ e.
R@@ i@@ ght@@ ? So you can do it.
They never give you a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you can't a@@ chi@@ ev@@ e.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of@@ , so you have to try har@@ d.
But there's no un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t@@ ; no sit@@ ting ar@@ oun@@ d, w@@ r@@ ing@@ ing your h@@ and@@ s -- there's always something speci@@ fi@@ c and important to be don@@ e.
There are also t@@ on@@ s of coll@@ abor@@ ator@@ s.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ where you g@@ o, h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of people read@@ y to work with you to a@@ chi@@ eve your e@@ pi@@ c mis@@ sion@@ .
That's not something we have in real life that ea@@ si@@ ly, this sen@@ se that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p@@ s are t@@ on@@ s of coll@@ abor@@ ator@@ s.
And there's this e@@ pi@@ c stor@@ y, this in@@ spi@@ r@@ ing stor@@ y of why we're ther@@ e, and what we're do@@ ing,
and we get all this positi@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ k.
You gu@@ ys have hear@@ d of l@@ ev@@ el@@ ing up@@ , +@@ 1 str@@ eng@@ th@@ , +@@ 1 intell@@ i@@ gen@@ c@@ e.
We don't get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real lif@@ e.
When I get off this st@@ ag@@ e, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 spe@@ ak@@ ing, and +@@ 1 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a, +@@ 20 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
I don't get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real lif@@ e.
Now, the prob@@ le@@ m with coll@@ abor@@ ative on@@ l@@ ine en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ s like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft is that it's so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in all the time, we deci@@ de to spen@@ d all our time in these g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s.
It's just better than re@@ al@@ ity.
So, so far@@ , coll@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely all the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spen@@ t 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ v@@ ing the vir@@ tu@@ al problem@@ s of A@@ z@@ er@@ o@@ th@@ .
Now, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y a b@@ ad thing.
It might so@@ un@@ d like it's a b@@ ad thing. But to put that in cont@@ ex@@ t@@ : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ag@@ o was when our ear@@ li@@ est pri@@ m@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ or@@ s st@@ ood up@@ .
That was the first u@@ pri@@ ght pri@@ mat@@ e.
So when we talk about how much time we're cur@@ r@@ ent@@ ly inv@@ est@@ ing in pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, the only way it ma@@ kes sen@@ se to even think about it is to talk about time at the ma@@ gn@@ itu@@ de of human evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ , which is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary thing. But it's also ap@@ t, because it tur@@ n@@ s out that by spen@@ ding all this time pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, we're actually chang@@ ing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ing@@ s. We@@ 're evol@@ v@@ ing to be a more coll@@ abor@@ ative and hear@@ t@@ y speci@@ es.
This is tr@@ u@@ e. I beli@@ eve this.
So, consi@@ der this really interest@@ ing st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ ;
it was re@@ cent@@ ly pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed by a re@@ se@@ arch@@ er at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on U@@ ni@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ :
The aver@@ age y@@ oun@@ g per@@ son to@@ day in a coun@@ try with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er cul@@ ture will have spen@@ t 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1@@ .
Now 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s is a really interest@@ ing num@@ ber for two reas@@ on@@ s.
F@@ ir@@ st of all@@ , for chil@@ dre@@ n in the Un@@ it@@ ed St@@ at@@ es, 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s is the ex@@ ac@@ t am@@ oun@@ t of time you will spen@@ d in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to hi@@ gh sch@@ oo@@ l gra@@ du@@ ation, if you have per@@ f@@ ec@@ t att@@ end@@ anc@@ e.
So, we have an enti@@ re par@@ all@@ el tr@@ ac@@ k of ed@@ uc@@ ation going on, where y@@ oun@@ g people are lear@@ ning as much about what it ta@@ kes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they're lear@@ ning about every@@ thing el@@ se in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
S@@ om@@ e of you have prob@@ ably re@@ ad M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ l@@ ad@@ w@@ ell@@ 's new bo@@ ok "@@ O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ,"
so you would have hear@@ d of his the@@ or@@ y of succ@@ es@@ s, the "@@ 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s@@ " the@@ or@@ y of succ@@ ess@@ .
It's bas@@ ed on this great co@@ gn@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ sci@@ ence re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch that sa@@ ys if we can ma@@ st@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of e@@ f@@ fort@@ ful stud@@ y at any@@ thing by the age of 2@@ 1@@ , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at it.
We will be as good at wh@@ at@@ ever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world.
And so, now what we're looking at is an enti@@ re gener@@ ation of y@@ oun@@ g people who are vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so g@@ am@@ er@@ s.
So, the big quest@@ ion is, "@@ What ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly are g@@ am@@ ers gett@@ ing so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could fi@@ gu@@ re that ou@@ t, we would have a vir@@ tu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed human re@@ s@@ our@@ ce on our h@@ and@@ s.
This is how many people we now have in the world who spen@@ d at le@@ ast an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
Th@@ ese are our vir@@ tu@@ o@@ so g@@ am@@ er@@ s,
5@@ 00 million people who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y good at some@@ thing.
And in the next de@@ ca@@ de, we're going to have another bi@@ ll@@ ion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y good at wh@@ at@@ ever that is.
If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing. The g@@ ame indu@@ str@@ y is develo@@ p@@ ing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ ener@@ gy and that work with the wi@@ rel@@ ess ph@@ one net@@ wor@@ ks in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Inter@@ net@@ , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the worl@@ d, partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in Indi@@ a, Ch@@ in@@ a, B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ , can get on@@ lin@@ e.
They ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t one bi@@ ll@@ ion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next de@@ ca@@ de.
It will br@@ ing us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 bi@@ ll@@ ion g@@ am@@ er@@ s.
So I've started to think about what these g@@ am@@ es are ma@@ king us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at@@ .
H@@ ere are the f@@ our things I came up with@@ . The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sm@@ .
OK@@ , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me self@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ation.
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is the desi@@ re to ac@@ t im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le, com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with the beli@@ e@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able h@@ op@@ e of succ@@ ess@@ .
G@@ am@@ ers always beli@@ eve that an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is possi@@ bl@@ e, and that it's always wor@@ th tr@@ y@@ ing, and trying no@@ w.
G@@ am@@ ers don't si@@ t ar@@ oun@@ d.
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at we@@ av@@ ing a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ric@@ .
Th@@ ere's a lot of interest@@ ing re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch that show@@ s we like people better after we pla@@ y a g@@ ame with them@@ , even if they@@ 've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ l@@ y.
And the reas@@ on is, it ta@@ kes a lot of tr@@ ust to pla@@ y a g@@ ame with some@@ one. We tr@@ ust that they will spen@@ d their time with us@@ , that they will pla@@ y by the same r@@ ul@@ es, val@@ ue the same go@@ al, st@@ a@@ y with the g@@ ame un@@ ti@@ l it's over@@ .
And so, pla@@ ying a g@@ ame tog@@ ether actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation.
And we actually buil@@ d str@@ on@@ g@@ er soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s as a re@@ sul@@ t.
B@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ vit@@ y. I lo@@ ve it.
You know, there's a reas@@ on why the aver@@ age W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k -- kind of a h@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ time j@@ ob@@ .
It's because we know, when we're pla@@ ying a g@@ am@@ e, that we're actually hap@@ pi@@ er wor@@ king h@@ ard than we are re@@ la@@ x@@ ing, or h@@ ang@@ ing ou@@ t.
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ z@@ ed as human be@@ ing@@ s, to do h@@ ard and mean@@ ing@@ ful wor@@ k.
And g@@ am@@ ers are wi@@ ll@@ ing to work h@@ ard all the time, if they're gi@@ v@@ en the right wor@@ k.
F@@ in@@ all@@ y@@ : e@@ pi@@ c mean@@ ing.
G@@ am@@ ers lo@@ ve to be att@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spi@@ r@@ ing mis@@ sion@@ s to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ sc@@ ale stori@@ es.
So, just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ p@@ s put that into per@@ spe@@ c@@ ti@@ ve@@ :
So, you all know W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a, bi@@ gg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
S@@ econ@@ d bi@@ gg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the worl@@ d, with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es, is the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i. F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th@@ .
They have com@@ pi@@ l@@ ed more in@@ form@@ ation about W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft on the Inter@@ ne@@ t than any other to@@ pi@@ c co@@ ver@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
They are buil@@ ding an e@@ pi@@ c stor@@ y.
They are buil@@ ding an e@@ pi@@ c know@@ l@@ ed@@ ge re@@ s@@ our@@ ce about the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t.
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, so these are f@@ our super@@ pow@@ ers that ad@@ d up to one thing@@ :
G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ pow@@ er@@ ed h@@ o@@ pe@@ ful indi@@ vidu@@ al@@ s.
Th@@ ese are people who beli@@ eve that they are indi@@ vidu@@ ally cap@@ able of chang@@ ing the world.
And the only prob@@ le@@ m is, they beli@@ eve that they are cap@@ able of chang@@ ing vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds and not the real world.
That's the prob@@ le@@ m that I'm trying to sol@@ v@@ e.
Th@@ ere's an econom@@ is@@ t nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ war@@ d C@@ a@@ str@@ on@@ ov@@ a.
H@@ is work is bri@@ ll@@ i@@ ant@@ . He loo@@ ks at why people are inv@@ est@@ ing so much time and ener@@ gy and mon@@ ey in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ d@@ s.
And he sa@@ ys, "@@ We@@ 're wit@@ ness@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no l@@ ess than a mas@@ s ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds and on@@ l@@ ine g@@ ame en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ s@@ ."
And h@@ e's an econom@@ ist@@ , so h@@ e's r@@ ation@@ al. And he sa@@ ys -- No@@ t like me, I'm a g@@ ame design@@ er@@ ; I'm ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant@@ .
But he sa@@ ys that this ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ec@@ t sen@@ se, because g@@ am@@ ers can a@@ chi@@ eve more in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ ds than they can in real lif@@ e.
They can have str@@ on@@ g@@ er soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s in g@@ am@@ es than they can have in real li@@ fe@@ ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and fe@@ el more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ am@@ es than they do in real lif@@ e.
So he sa@@ ys, for now it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ec@@ t sen@@ se for g@@ am@@ ers to spen@@ d more time in vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds than the real world. Now, I also ag@@ re@@ e that that is r@@ ation@@ al, for no@@ w. But it is no@@ t, by any mean@@ s, an op@@ ti@@ ma@@ l s@@ itu@@ ation. We have to start ma@@ king the real world work more like a g@@ am@@ e.
I take my in@@ spi@@ r@@ ation from something that happen@@ ed 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years ag@@ o.
Th@@ ese are an@@ ci@@ ent dic@@ e, made out of sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ l@@ es. Be@@ for@@ e we had a@@ w@@ es@@ om@@ e g@@ ame controll@@ er@@ s, we had sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ l@@ es. And these re@@ pres@@ ent the first g@@ ame e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment design@@ ed by human be@@ ing@@ s,
and if you're fam@@ i@@ li@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ e@@ k h@@ ist@@ ori@@ an H@@ er@@ o@@ dot@@ us@@ , you might know this h@@ ist@@ or@@ y,
which is the h@@ ist@@ or@@ y of who invent@@ ed g@@ am@@ es and wh@@ y.
H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ tu@@ s sa@@ ys that g@@ am@@ es, partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly dice g@@ am@@ es, were invent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ do@@ m of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, dur@@ ing a time of fam@@ in@@ e.
A@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly, there was su@@ ch a se@@ v@@ ere fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a deci@@ ded they had to do something c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
P@@ e@@ ople were su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing. P@@ e@@ ople were fi@@ ght@@ ing. It was an ex@@ tre@@ me s@@ itu@@ ation, they ne@@ e@@ ded an ex@@ tre@@ me solut@@ ion@@ .
So, ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ dot@@ us@@ , they invent@@ ed dice g@@ am@@ es, and they se@@ t up a k@@ ing@@ do@@ m@@ -@@ wi@@ de pol@@ ic@@ y@@ :
O@@ n one da@@ y, every@@ body would e@@ at@@ ,
and on the next da@@ y, every@@ body would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es.
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in pla@@ ying the dice g@@ am@@ es, because g@@ am@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in su@@ ch s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ y@@ ing, b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ vit@@ y, they would i@@ gn@@ ore the fac@@ t that they had no f@@ ood to e@@ at@@ .
And then on the next da@@ y, they would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es@@ ; and on the next da@@ y, they would e@@ at@@ .
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ dot@@ us@@ , they pass@@ ed 1@@ 8 years this way, sur@@ viv@@ ing through a fam@@ in@@ e, by e@@ ating on one da@@ y, and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on the nex@@ t.
Now, this is ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly, I thin@@ k, how we're us@@ ing g@@ am@@ es to@@ da@@ y. We@@ 're us@@ ing g@@ am@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e re@@ al@@ -@@ world su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing --
we're us@@ ing g@@ am@@ es to get a@@ way
from every@@ thing that's b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in the real en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ , every@@ thing that's not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real lif@@ e, and we're gett@@ ing what we need from g@@ am@@ es.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really ex@@ cit@@ ing. A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ dot@@ us@@ , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine was@@ n't gett@@ ing bet@@ ter@@ , so the king deci@@ ded they would pla@@ y one fin@@ al dice g@@ am@@ e.
They divi@@ ded the enti@@ re k@@ ing@@ do@@ m in h@@ al@@ f@@ . They pla@@ y@@ ed one dice g@@ am@@ e, and the w@@ in@@ n@@ ers of that g@@ ame got to go on an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ u@@ re.
They would le@@ ave L@@ y@@ di@@ a, and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new pl@@ ace to liv@@ e, le@@ av@@ ing be@@ h@@ in@@ d just en@@ ou@@ gh people to sur@@ vi@@ ve on the re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es that were av@@ a@@ il@@ ab@@ le, and h@@ o@@ pe@@ fu@@ ll@@ y to take their ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where el@@ se where they could th@@ riv@@ e.
Now, this so@@ un@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y, ri@@ ght@@ ?
But re@@ cent@@ ly, D@@ N@@ A e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence has sh@@ own that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then l@@ ed to the R@@ o@@ man E@@ m@@ pi@@ re, actually sh@@ are the same D@@ N@@ A as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ an@@ s.
And so, re@@ cent@@ ly, sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s have su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that H@@ er@@ o@@ dot@@ us@@ ' c@@ ra@@ z@@ y stor@@ y is actually tr@@ u@@ e.
And ge@@ olo@@ gi@@ st@@ s have f@@ ound e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence of a glob@@ al co@@ ol@@ ing that l@@ ast@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 year@@ s, that could have ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ in@@ e.
So this c@@ ra@@ z@@ y stor@@ y might be tr@@ u@@ e. They might have actually s@@ av@@ ed their cul@@ ture by pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 year@@ s, and then been so in@@ spi@@ re@@ d, and k@@ new so much about how to come tog@@ ether with g@@ am@@ es, that they actually s@@ av@@ ed the enti@@ re ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that wa@@ y.
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, we can do that.
We@@ 've been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft sin@@ ce 19@@ 9@@ 4@@ .
That was the first re@@ al@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y g@@ ame from the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft seri@@ es. That was 1@@ 6 years ag@@ o.
They pla@@ y@@ ed dice g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 year@@ s, we've been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 year@@ s.
I say we are read@@ y for our own e@@ pi@@ c g@@ am@@ e.
Now, they had h@@ al@@ f the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new worl@@ d,
so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 bi@@ ll@@ ion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k of g@@ am@@ e-@@ pla@@ y fro@@ m@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's get h@@ al@@ f of us to ag@@ re@@ e to spen@@ d an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, un@@ ti@@ l we sol@@ ve re@@ al@@ -@@ world problem@@ s.
Now, I know you're as@@ k@@ ing, "@@ How are we going to sol@@ ve re@@ al@@ -@@ world problem@@ s in g@@ am@@ es@@ ?" Well, that's what I've dev@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the pas@@ t few year@@ s, at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We have this b@@ ann@@ er in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to, and it ex@@ pres@@ se@@ s our vi@@ e@@ w of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the fut@@ u@@ re.
We do not want to try to pre@@ dic@@ t the fut@@ u@@ re.
What we want to do is make the fut@@ u@@ re.
We want to imag@@ ine the b@@ est@@ -@@ cas@@ e sc@@ en@@ ario out@@ com@@ e, and then we want to em@@ pow@@ er people to make that out@@ come a re@@ al@@ ity.
We want to imag@@ ine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s, and then give people the mean@@ s to a@@ chi@@ eve the e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
I'm just going to very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly show you three g@@ am@@ es that I've made that are an att@@ em@@ p@@ t to give people the mean@@ s to cre@@ ate e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s in their own fut@@ u@@ re@@ s.
This is W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ th@@ out O@@ il@@ .
We made this g@@ ame in 200@@ 7@@ .
This is an on@@ l@@ ine g@@ ame in which you try to sur@@ vi@@ ve an o@@ il sh@@ or@@ t@@ ag@@ e.
The o@@ il sh@@ or@@ t@@ age is fic@@ tion@@ al, but we put en@@ ou@@ gh on@@ l@@ ine cont@@ ent out there for you to beli@@ eve that it's re@@ al, and to li@@ ve your real life as if we've r@@ un out of o@@ il@@ . So when you come to the g@@ am@@ e, you si@@ gn up@@ , tell us where you liv@@ e, and then we give you re@@ al@@ -@@ time ne@@ w@@ s vide@@ o@@ s, d@@ ata fe@@ ed@@ s that show you ex@@ ac@@ t@@ ly how much o@@ il cost@@ s, wh@@ at's not av@@ a@@ il@@ ab@@ le, how f@@ ood sup@@ pl@@ y is being aff@@ ec@@ t@@ ed,
how trans@@ port@@ ation is being aff@@ ec@@ t@@ ed, if sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s are clo@@ se@@ d, if there's ri@@ ot@@ ing, and you have to fi@@ gu@@ re out how you would li@@ ve your real life as if this were tr@@ u@@ e. And then we as@@ k you to blo@@ g about it, to pos@@ t vide@@ o@@ s, to pos@@ t ph@@ ot@@ o@@ s.
We pi@@ lo@@ ted this g@@ ame with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pla@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 7@@ , and we've tr@@ ac@@ ked them for the three years s@@ inc@@ e. And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ form@@ ative ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
No@@ body want@@ s to change how they liv@@ e, just because it's good for the worl@@ d, or because we're sup@@ pos@@ ed to.
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them@@ , "@@ We@@ 've r@@ un out of o@@ il@@ .
This is an am@@ az@@ ing stor@@ y and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you@@ r@@ sel@@ f to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ ve@@ ,"
most of our pla@@ y@@ ers have ke@@ p@@ t up the h@@ ab@@ its that they lear@@ ned in this g@@ am@@ e.
So for the next worl@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ av@@ ing g@@ am@@ e, we deci@@ ded to ai@@ m hi@@ gh@@ er -- bi@@ gg@@ er prob@@ le@@ m than just pe@@ a@@ k o@@ il@@ .
We did a g@@ ame called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re. And the pre@@ mi@@ se was@@ , a super@@ computer has c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated that hu@@ man@@ s have only 2@@ 3 years le@@ ft on the plan@@ et@@ .
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al E@@ x@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess S@@ y@@ stem@@ , of cour@@ s@@ e.
We as@@ ked people to come on@@ l@@ ine -- al@@ most like a J@@ er@@ ry B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mo@@ vi@@ e.
You know J@@ er@@ ry B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mo@@ vi@@ es, you for@@ m a dre@@ am te@@ am -- you@@ 've got the a@@ str@@ on@@ aut@@ , the sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t, and they all have something to do to s@@ ave the world. But in our g@@ am@@ e, in@@ ste@@ ad of just hav@@ ing fi@@ ve people on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , we said, "@@ E@@ ver@@ y@@ bod@@ y@@ 's on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , and it's your jo@@ b to inv@@ ent the fut@@ ure of ener@@ g@@ y, the fut@@ ure of f@@ oo@@ d, the fut@@ ure of he@@ al@@ th@@ , the fut@@ ure of se@@ cur@@ ity and the fut@@ ure of the soci@@ al sa@@ f@@ et@@ y net@@ ."
We had 8@@ ,000 people pla@@ y that g@@ ame for ei@@ ght we@@ e@@ k@@ s. They came up with 5@@ 00 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative solut@@ ions that you can go on@@ lin@@ e, Go@@ og@@ le "@@ Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and se@@ e.
So, fin@@ ally, the last g@@ am@@ e, we're la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a g@@ ame d@@ one with the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ e.
If you compl@@ ete the g@@ am@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ it@@ ute as a S@@ o@@ ci@@ al In@@ nov@@ ator@@ , c@@ las@@ s of 20@@ 1@@ 0@@ .
W@@ or@@ king with univers@@ iti@@ es all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Afric@@ a, and we are in@@ vit@@ ing them to lear@@ n soci@@ al in@@ nov@@ ation s@@ ki@@ ll@@ s.
We@@ 've got a gra@@ ph@@ ic nov@@ el@@ , we've got l@@ ev@@ el@@ ing up in s@@ ki@@ ll@@ s like lo@@ ca@@ l insi@@ ght, know@@ l@@ ed@@ ge net@@ wor@@ k@@ ing, su@@ st@@ ain@@ abilit@@ y, vi@@ sion and re@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness@@ .
I would like to in@@ vit@@ e all of you to pl@@ e@@ ase sh@@ are this g@@ ame with y@@ oun@@ g peopl@@ e, any@@ where in the worl@@ d, partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in develo@@ p@@ ing are@@ as@@ , who might ben@@ e@@ f@@ it from com@@ ing tog@@ ether to try to start to imag@@ ine their own soci@@ al ent@@ er@@ pri@@ se@@ s to s@@ ave the world.
So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up no@@ w.
I want to as@@ k a question@@ .
What do you think happen@@ s nex@@ t@@ ?
We@@ 've got all these am@@ az@@ ing g@@ am@@ er@@ s, we've got these g@@ am@@ es that are kind of pi@@ lo@@ ts of what we might do, but n@@ one of them have s@@ av@@ ed the real world y@@ et@@ .
W@@ ell I h@@ op@@ e you will ag@@ re@@ e with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human re@@ s@@ our@@ ce that we can use to do re@@ al@@ -@@ world wor@@ k, that g@@ am@@ es are a pow@@ er@@ ful pl@@ at@@ for@@ m for chang@@ e. We have all these am@@ az@@ ing super@@ pow@@ er@@ s@@ : b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ vit@@ y, the abilit@@ y to we@@ ave a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ric@@ , this fe@@ el@@ ing of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and the desi@@ re for e@@ pi@@ c mean@@ ing.
I really h@@ op@@ e that we can come tog@@ ether to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es that mat@@ ter@@ , to sur@@ vi@@ ve on this plan@@ et for another cent@@ ur@@ y. That's my h@@ op@@ e, that you will jo@@ in me in ma@@ king and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es like this.
When I look for@@ war@@ d to the next de@@ ca@@ de, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any fut@@ ure we can imag@@ in@@ e, and we can pla@@ y any g@@ am@@ es we want@@ , so I sa@@ y@@ :
L@@ et the worl@@ d@@ -@@ chang@@ ing g@@ am@@ es be@@ gin@@ .
Thank you.
F@@ or some time I have been interest@@ ed in the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t, which might se@@ e@@ m like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interest@@ ed in, un@@ l@@ ess you think of it in the ter@@ m@@ s that I do, which is, "@@ S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke is beli@@ ev@@ ed in en@@ ou@@ gh by some@@ body that it be@@ comes something re@@ al@@ ." In other wor@@ d@@ s, su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ ll@@ s have a me@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble eff@@ ec@@ t in cer@@ ta@@ in kin@@ ds of studi@@ es, the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t, just because the per@@ son thin@@ ks
that wh@@ at's happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical or some sort of a --
for pa@@ in man@@ ag@@ ement@@ , for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, if they beli@@ eve it en@@ ou@@ gh there is a me@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble eff@@ ec@@ t in the body called the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ on@@ e's per@@ ce@@ p@@ tion of it.
In or@@ der for us to underst@@ and each other@@ , I want to start by show@@ ing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ar@@ y, very sim@@ p@@ le ma@@ gi@@ c tr@@ ic@@ k.
And I'm going to show you how it wor@@ k@@ s. This is a tr@@ ic@@ k that's been in every chil@@ d@@ ren@@ 's ma@@ gi@@ c bo@@ ok sin@@ ce at le@@ ast the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s.
I lear@@ ned it m@@ y@@ sel@@ f from C@@ u@@ b S@@ co@@ ut Ma@@ gi@@ c in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.
I'll do it for you@@ , and then I'll ex@@ pla@@ in it.
And then I'll ex@@ pla@@ in why I ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed it.
So, her@@ e's what happen@@ s.
The k@@ ni@@ f@@ e, which you can ex@@ am@@ in@@ e@@ ; my h@@ and, which you could ex@@ am@@ in@@ e.
I'm just going to h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e in my fi@@ st like this.
I'll get my s@@ le@@ eve bac@@ k.
And to make su@@ re no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ eve
I'm just going to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here.
That way you can see that at no time can any@@ thing tr@@ av@@ el@@ , as long as I'm s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing there no@@ thing can go up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e.
And the ob@@ jec@@ t of this is qu@@ ite sim@@ pl@@ e.
I'm going to o@@ pe@@ n my h@@ and, and h@@ o@@ pe@@ fu@@ ll@@ y, if all is w@@ ell, my pu@@ re ani@@ ma@@ l ma@@ gn@@ et@@ is@@ m will h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e.
In fac@@ t it's hel@@ d so ti@@ ght@@ ly in pl@@ ace that I can sh@@ a@@ ke it, and the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e does not come off@@ .
No@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e,
no tr@@ ick@@ er@@ y. And you can ex@@ am@@ ine every@@ thing.
T@@ a@@ -@@ da@@ !
So, this is a tr@@ ic@@ k that I of@@ t@@ en te@@ ach to y@@ oun@@ g chil@@ dre@@ n
that are interest@@ ed in mag@@ ic@@ , because you can lear@@ n a great de@@ al about de@@ ce@@ p@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even thou@@ gh it's a very sim@@ p@@ le tr@@ ic@@ k me@@ th@@ o@@ d@@ olog@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably many of you in the ro@@ o@@ m know this tr@@ ic@@ k.
What happen@@ s is this. I h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e in my h@@ and@@ .
I say I'm going to gra@@ b h@@ old of my w@@ ri@@ st
to make su@@ re no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reas@@ on I'm h@@ ol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ ri@@ st is because that's actually the se@@ cre@@ t of the ill@@ u@@ sion@@ .
In a mom@@ ent when my h@@ and mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being a@@ way from you@@ , this f@@ ing@@ er right here, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to sh@@ if@@ t from where it is, to a positi@@ on po@@ int@@ ing out like this. N@@ ice one.
S@@ om@@ e@@ one who didn't have a chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood is out there.
So, it go@@ es like this, from here, ri@@ gh@@ t.
And as I mo@@ ve around my f@@ ing@@ er sh@@ if@@ t@@ s.
And we could talk about why this is de@@ ce@@ p@@ tiv@@ e, why you don't no@@ tic@@ e there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here, because the min@@ d, and the way it proc@@ es@@ se@@ s in@@ form@@ ation, it doesn't coun@@ t, one, tw@@ o, thre@@ e. It gro@@ up@@ s them.
But that's not really what this is ab@@ ou@@ t. R@@ i@@ ght@@ ? And then I o@@ pe@@ n my h@@ and up@@ . O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly it's cl@@ ing@@ ing ther@@ e, not by ani@@ ma@@ l ma@@ gn@@ et@@ is@@ m@@ , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there.
And then when I clo@@ se my f@@ ing@@ er, same thing@@ , as I mo@@ ve bac@@ k, this mo@@ tion kind of co@@ ver@@ s the mov@@ ing back of my f@@ ing@@ er.
I take this h@@ and a@@ wa@@ y. You give the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e ou@@ t.
There is a tr@@ ic@@ k you can do for your fri@@ end@@ s and ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s. Th@@ an@@ k@@ s.
Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t@@ ?
I re@@ ad a stud@@ y a ye@@ ar or so ag@@ o that really b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d wi@@ de op@@ en@@ .
I'm not a do@@ c@@ t@@ or or a re@@ se@@ arch@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ on@@ i@@ sh@@ ing thing.
It tur@@ n@@ s out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the for@@ m of a wh@@ ite pi@@ ll@@ , that's like as@@ pi@@ r@@ in sh@@ ap@@ ed -- it's just a ro@@ un@@ d wh@@ ite pi@@ ll -- it has some cer@@ ta@@ in me@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ ble eff@@ ec@@ t.
But if you change the for@@ m that you give the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in, like you make a sm@@ all@@ er pi@@ ll@@ , and colo@@ r it bl@@ u@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a l@@ etter into it, it is actually me@@ as@@ u@@ ra@@ b@@ ly more eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ e.
E@@ v@@ en thou@@ gh ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical -- they're su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ ll@@ s.
But a wh@@ ite pi@@ ll is not as good as a bl@@ ue pi@@ ll@@ .
Wh@@ at@@ ? That really f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed me ou@@ t.
T@@ ur@@ n@@ s out thou@@ gh@@ , that that's not even where it st@@ op@@ s.
If you have cap@@ sul@@ es, they're more eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve than t@@ ab@@ let@@ s in any form@@ .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le, that's y@@ ell@@ ow on one end and red on the other is better than a wh@@ ite cap@@ su@@ le.
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this.
O@@ ne pi@@ ll tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three pi@@ ll@@ s -- I don't rem@@ em@@ ber the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic no@@ w. S@@ or@@ r@@ y.
But the po@@ int is ...
... these do@@ s@@ ag@@ es have something to do with it.
And the for@@ m has something to do with it.
And if you want the ul@@ tim@@ ate in plac@@ e@@ b@@ o, you@@ 've go to the ne@@ ed@@ le.
R@@ i@@ ght@@ ? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ er@@ t -- a co@@ up@@ le C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ er@@ t some@@ thing@@ ,
and you in@@ jec@@ t this into a p@@ ati@@ ent ...
W@@ ell this is su@@ ch a pow@@ er@@ ful imag@@ e in their min@@ d, it's so much str@@ on@@ g@@ er than the wh@@ ite pi@@ ll@@ .
It's a re@@ ally, this gra@@ ph@@ , w@@ ell I'll show it to you some other time when we have s@@ li@@ de@@ s.
The po@@ int is the wh@@ ite pi@@ ll is not as good as the bl@@ ue pi@@ ll is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ le.
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical qual@@ it@@ y,
it's only your beli@@ e@@ f that ma@@ kes it real in your body and ma@@ kes a str@@ on@@ g@@ er eff@@ ec@@ t.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and ap@@ pl@@ y it to a ma@@ gi@@ c tr@@ ic@@ k.
And take something that is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly a fa@@ ke tr@@ ic@@ k and make it se@@ e@@ m re@@ al.
And we know from that stud@@ y that when you want re@@ al@@ it@@ y, you go to the ne@@ ed@@ le.
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in. It's ver@@ y, very sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ,
and I'm going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a t@@ in@@ y b@@ it.
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h@@ . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an@@ 's speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h@@ .
That's my s@@ k@@ in right there. This is not a H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t.
I'm going to pi@@ er@@ ce my s@@ k@@ in and r@@ un this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other si@@ de.
If you're qu@@ e@@ as@@ y -- if you f@@ ain@@ t ea@@ si@@ ly -- I was doing this for some fri@@ end@@ s in the h@@ ot@@ el ro@@ o@@ m last ni@@ ght, and some people that I didn't know, and one w@@ o@@ man al@@ most pass@@ ed ou@@ t.
So, I su@@ gg@@ est if you get qu@@ e@@ as@@ y e@@ as@@ y that you look a@@ way for about the next 3@@ 0 -- in fac@@ t, you know wh@@ at@@ , I'll do the first b@@ ad part be@@ h@@ in@@ d it.
Y@@ ou@@ 'll get to se@@ e, you can look a@@ way to@@ o if you@@ '@@ d like to.
So, here is what happen@@ s, right here, the be@@ gin@@ ning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the low@@ er part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ c@@ e.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y, man@@ . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you out@@ ?
OK@@ , and then just through my s@@ k@@ in a t@@ in@@ y b@@ it, and then out the other si@@ de like this.
Now, ess@@ enti@@ ally we're in the same positi@@ on we were in with the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e tr@@ ic@@ k.
S@@ or@@ t of@@ . But you can't coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?
So, le@@ t me show them to you. That's one, two thre@@ e, f@@ our@@ , fi@@ v@@ e. Y@@ es, w@@ ell@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They g@@ o, "@@ Well, h@@ e's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly not du@@ m@@ b en@@ ou@@ gh to st@@ a@@ b h@@ im@@ sel@@ f through the s@@ k@@ in to ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in us for a few min@@ ut@@ es.
So, le@@ t me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k.
H@@ ow@@ 's that look out ther@@ e? P@@ re@@ tt@@ y go@@ o@@ d.
Y@@ ea@@ h, I know@@ . And the people in the back g@@ o, "@@ OK@@ , I didn't really see that@@ ."
P@@ e@@ ople in the s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite ro@@ o@@ m are star@@ ting to mo@@ ve in no@@ w.
L@@ et me give you good clo@@ se look at this.
That really is my s@@ kin@@ . That is not a H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t.
That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can tw@@ is@@ t that ar@@ oun@@ d.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y. If you're gett@@ ing qu@@ e@@ as@@ y, look a@@ way, don't look at the thing.
P@@ e@@ ople in the back or people on vide@@ o years from now wat@@ ch@@ ing this will g@@ o, "@@ W@@ ell y@@ ea@@ h, that loo@@ ks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ec@@ t ther@@ e, but if it were real he would be --
see there's a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole ther@@ e, if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing.
W@@ ell le@@ t me work up some b@@ loo@@ d for you.
Y@@ es, there it is.
N@@ or@@ m@@ ally no@@ w, I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le ou@@ t.
I would c@@ le@@ an off my ar@@ m@@ , and I would show you that there are no w@@ oun@@ d@@ s.
But I think in this cont@@ ex@@ t and with the idea of ta@@ king something fa@@ ke and ma@@ king it into something re@@ al, I'm just going to le@@ ave it ther@@ e, and w@@ alk off the st@@ ag@@ e.
I will be se@@ e@@ ing you se@@ ver@@ al tim@@ es over the next few da@@ y@@ s. I h@@ op@@ e you're looking for@@ war@@ d to that. Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
So, I've kno@@ wn a lot of fi@@ s@@ h in my lif@@ e.
I've lo@@ v@@ ed only tw@@ o.
That first one, it was more like a pas@@ sion@@ ate aff@@ air@@ .
It was a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful fi@@ sh@@ : f@@ lavor@@ ful@@ , t@@ ex@@ tu@@ re@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a b@@ est@@ se@@ ll@@ er on the men@@ u@@ .
What a fi@@ sh@@ .
E@@ v@@ en bet@@ ter@@ , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ pos@@ ed hi@@ gh@@ est st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ st@@ ain@@ abilit@@ y.
So you could fe@@ el good about se@@ ll@@ ing it.
I was in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this be@@ aut@@ y for se@@ ver@@ al mon@@ th@@ s.
O@@ ne da@@ y, the he@@ ad of the comp@@ any called and as@@ ked if I'@@ d spe@@ a@@ k at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m@@ 's su@@ st@@ ain@@ abilit@@ y.
"@@ A@@ b@@ solut@@ el@@ y@@ ," I sai@@ d.
H@@ ere was a comp@@ any trying to sol@@ ve wh@@ at's be@@ come this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able prob@@ le@@ m for us ch@@ e@@ f@@ s@@ :
How do we ke@@ ep fi@@ s@@ h on our men@@ us@@ ?
F@@ or the pas@@ t 50 year@@ s, we've been fi@@ sh@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut for@@ est@@ s.
It's h@@ ard to over@@ state the de@@ struc@@ tion@@ .
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of lar@@ ge fi@@ sh@@ , the on@@ es we lo@@ ve -- the t@@ un@@ as@@ , the h@@ ali@@ b@@ ut@@ s, the sal@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ fi@@ s@@ h -- they@@ 've coll@@ ap@@ se@@ d.
Th@@ ere's al@@ most no@@ thing le@@ f@@ t.
So, for better or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, fi@@ s@@ h far@@ m@@ ing, is going to be a part of our fut@@ u@@ re.
A lot of ar@@ gu@@ ment@@ s again@@ st it@@ :
F@@ is@@ h far@@ m@@ s po@@ ll@@ ute -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent@@ . T@@ a@@ ke t@@ un@@ a,
a ma@@ j@@ or d@@ ra@@ w@@ bac@@ k. It's got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 1@@ 5 to one.
That mean@@ s it ta@@ kes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ un@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fi@@ s@@ h to get you one po@@ un@@ d of far@@ m t@@ un@@ a.
No@@ t very su@@ st@@ ain@@ ab@@ le.
It doesn't ta@@ st@@ e very good ei@@ ther@@ .
So here, fin@@ ally, was a comp@@ any trying to do it ri@@ gh@@ t.
I wanted to sup@@ por@@ t them.
The day befor@@ e the ev@@ ent@@ , I called the he@@ ad of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ an@@ y.
L@@ et@@ 's call hi@@ m D@@ on.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ i@@ ght, you gu@@ ys are fam@@ ous for far@@ m@@ ing so far out to se@@ a, you don't po@@ ll@@ ut@@ e@@ ."
"@@ That's ri@@ ght@@ ," he sai@@ d. "@@ We@@ 're so far ou@@ t, the wa@@ st@@ e from our fi@@ s@@ h get@@ s di@@ stri@@ b@@ ut@@ ed, not con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ We@@ 're bas@@ ically a world un@@ to our@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o? 2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ B@@ est in the busin@@ ess@@ ."
2@@ .@@ 5 to one, gre@@ at@@ .
"@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 wh@@ at@@ ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ te@@ in@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ G@@ re@@ at@@ ," I sai@@ d. Go@@ t off the ph@@ one.
And that ni@@ ght, I was l@@ ying in be@@ d, and I thou@@ ght@@ : What the h@@ ell is a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ te@@ in@@ ?
So the next da@@ y, just befor@@ e the ev@@ ent@@ , I called D@@ on.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what are some ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ te@@ in@@ s@@ ?"
He said he didn't know@@ . He would as@@ k ar@@ oun@@ d.
Well, I got on the ph@@ one with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ; no one could give me a stra@@ i@@ ght ans@@ w@@ er
un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally, I got on the ph@@ one with the he@@ ad bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's call hi@@ m D@@ on to@@ o.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pro@@ te@@ in@@ s@@ ?"
Well, he ment@@ ion@@ ed some al@@ g@@ a@@ es and some fi@@ s@@ h me@@ al@@ s, and then he said ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ et@@ s.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ et@@ s@@ ?"
He said, "@@ Y@@ ea@@ h, fe@@ a@@ ther@@ s, s@@ kin@@ , b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ rap@@ s, d@@ ri@@ ed and proc@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed@@ ."
I said, "@@ What per@@ cent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ in@@ k@@ ing, you know, two per@@ cent@@ .
"@@ Well, it's about 3@@ 0 per@@ cent@@ ," he sai@@ d.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, wh@@ at's su@@ st@@ ain@@ able about fe@@ ed@@ ing ch@@ ick@@ en to fi@@ sh@@ ?"
There was a long pa@@ use on the lin@@ e, and he said, "@@ Th@@ ere's just to@@ o much ch@@ ick@@ en in the worl@@ d@@ ."
I f@@ ell out of lo@@ ve with this fi@@ sh@@ .
N@@ o, not because I'm some self@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ou@@ s, go@@ o@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ two sh@@ o@@ es f@@ oo@@ di@@ e.
I actually am@@ .
N@@ o, I actually f@@ ell out of lo@@ ve with this fi@@ s@@ h be@@ caus@@ e, I s@@ we@@ ar to Go@@ d, after that con@@ vers@@ ation, the fi@@ s@@ h ta@@ st@@ ed like ch@@ ick@@ en@@ .
This secon@@ d fi@@ sh@@ , it's a different kind of lo@@ ve stor@@ y.
It's the ro@@ man@@ ti@@ c kin@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your fi@@ sh@@ , you lo@@ ve the fi@@ sh@@ .
I first ate it at a rest@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in.
A j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t fri@@ end had been tal@@ king about this fi@@ s@@ h for a long time.
S@@ he kind of se@@ t us up@@ .
It came to the t@@ able a bri@@ ght, al@@ most sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, wh@@ ite col@@ or@@ .
The ch@@ e@@ f had over@@ co@@ o@@ ked it.
L@@ i@@ ke tw@@ ice over@@ .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still de@@ l@@ ici@@ ou@@ s.
W@@ ho can make a fi@@ s@@ h ta@@ st@@ e good after it's been over@@ co@@ o@@ k@@ ed@@ ?
I can@@ '@@ t, but this gu@@ y can@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's call hi@@ m M@@ i@@ gu@@ el --
actually his n@@ ame is M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ .
And no, he didn't co@@ ok the fi@@ sh@@ , and h@@ e's not a ch@@ e@@ f@@ ,
at le@@ ast in the way that you and I underst@@ and it.
H@@ e's a bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st at V@@ et@@ a La P@@ al@@ ma@@ . It's a fi@@ s@@ h far@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est@@ er@@ n cor@@ n@@ er of S@@ pa@@ in. It's at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver@@ .
Un@@ ti@@ l the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, the far@@ m was in the h@@ and@@ s of the A@@ r@@ g@@ ent@@ ini@@ an@@ s.
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le on what was ess@@ enti@@ ally w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s.
They did it by d@@ ra@@ in@@ ing the l@@ and@@ . They buil@@ t this in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ate seri@@ es of can@@ al@@ s, and they p@@ us@@ h@@ ed wat@@ er off the l@@ and and out into the ri@@ ver@@ .
Well, they coul@@ dn't make it wor@@ k, not econom@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
And e@@ colo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally, it was a di@@ sa@@ st@@ er.
It ki@@ ll@@ ed like 9@@ 0 percent of the bi@@ r@@ d@@ s, wh@@ ich@@ , for this plac@@ e, is a lot of bi@@ r@@ d@@ s.
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2@@ , a S@@ pan@@ is@@ h comp@@ any with an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al con@@ sci@@ ence p@@ ur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the l@@ and@@ .
What did they do@@ ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of wat@@ er.
They lit@@ er@@ ally f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed the s@@ wit@@ ch@@ .
In@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ us@@ h@@ ing wat@@ er ou@@ t, they used the ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l@@ s to pul@@ l wat@@ er back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ al@@ s.
They cre@@ ated a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re fi@@ s@@ h far@@ m -- bas@@ s, mu@@ ll@@ et@@ , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p@@ , e@@ el -- and in the proc@@ es@@ s, M@@ i@@ gu@@ el and this comp@@ any complet@@ ely re@@ vers@@ ed the e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical de@@ struc@@ tion@@ .
The far@@ m@@ 's incredi@@ bl@@ e.
I mean@@ , you@@ 've never se@@ en any@@ thing like this.
You st@@ are out at a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that is a million mi@@ les a@@ way, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k, ric@@ h mar@@ sh@@ l@@ and@@ .
I was there not long ag@@ o with M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ .
H@@ e's an am@@ az@@ ing gu@@ y, like three par@@ ts Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e.
O@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ ? There we are s@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing through the w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s, and I'm p@@ ant@@ ing and s@@ we@@ at@@ ing, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a bi@@ olog@@ y l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re.
H@@ ere, h@@ e's po@@ int@@ ing out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ it@@ e.
Now, h@@ e's ment@@ ion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al ne@@ ed@@ s of ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on. And here, here he se@@ es a gro@@ up@@ ing p@@ atter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds hi@@ m of the T@@ anz@@ ani@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.
It tur@@ n@@ s ou@@ t, M@@ i@@ gu@@ el spen@@ t the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the M@@ i@@ k@@ u@@ mi N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k in Afric@@ a.
I as@@ ked hi@@ m how he be@@ came su@@ ch an ex@@ per@@ t on fi@@ sh@@ .
He said, "@@ F@@ i@@ sh@@ ? I didn't know any@@ thing about fi@@ sh@@ .
I'm an ex@@ per@@ t in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ ."
And then h@@ e's off@@ , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing into more talk about r@@ are bi@@ r@@ ds and al@@ g@@ a@@ es and str@@ ang@@ e a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c pl@@ ant@@ s.
And don't get me w@@ ron@@ g@@ , that was really f@@ as@@ cin@@ at@@ ing, you know, the bi@@ o@@ ti@@ c commun@@ ity un@@ pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed, kind of thing.
It's gre@@ at@@ , but I was in lo@@ v@@ e.
And my he@@ ad was s@@ w@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ co@@ o@@ ked pi@@ ece of de@@ l@@ ici@@ ous fi@@ s@@ h I had the ni@@ ght befor@@ e.
So I inter@@ r@@ up@@ ted h@@ im@@ . I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , what ma@@ kes your fi@@ s@@ h ta@@ st@@ e so go@@ o@@ d@@ ?"
He po@@ int@@ ed at the al@@ g@@ a@@ e.
"@@ I know, du@@ de, the al@@ g@@ a@@ e, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ : It's am@@ az@@ ing.
But what are your fi@@ s@@ h e@@ at@@ ing@@ ?
Wh@@ at's the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ?"
Well, he go@@ es on to tell me it's su@@ ch a ric@@ h sy@@ ste@@ m that the fi@@ s@@ h are e@@ ating what they@@ '@@ d be e@@ ating in the w@@ il@@ d.
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ ed@@ s the fi@@ sh@@ .
The sy@@ ste@@ m is so he@@ al@@ th@@ y, it's t@@ ot@@ ally self@@ -@@ ren@@ e@@ w@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver hear@@ d of a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s@@ ?
L@@ at@@ er that da@@ y, I was d@@ riv@@ ing around this pro@@ per@@ t@@ y with M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , and I as@@ ked h@@ im@@ , I said, "@@ F@@ or a pl@@ ace that se@@ em@@ s so natur@@ al, un@@ like like any far@@ m I'@@ d ever been at@@ , how do you me@@ as@@ ure succ@@ ess@@ ?"
A@@ t that mom@@ ent@@ , it was as if a fil@@ m dire@@ c@@ t@@ or called for a se@@ t chang@@ e.
And we ro@@ un@@ ded the cor@@ n@@ er and sa@@ w the most am@@ az@@ ing si@@ ght@@ : thou@@ s@@ and@@ s and thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, a lit@@ er@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could se@@ e.
"@@ That's succ@@ ess@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ L@@ oo@@ k at their bell@@ i@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.
Th@@ ey@@ 're fe@@ ast@@ ing@@ ."
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing@@ ? I was t@@ ot@@ ally con@@ f@@ us@@ ed.
I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , ar@@ en@@ 't they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fi@@ sh@@ ?"
"@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ We lo@@ se 20 percent of our fi@@ s@@ h and fi@@ s@@ h e@@ gg@@ s to bi@@ r@@ d@@ s.
Well, last year@@ , this pro@@ per@@ t@@ y had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bi@@ r@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es.
It's be@@ com@@ e, to@@ da@@ y, the lar@@ g@@ est and one of the most important pri@@ v@@ ate bi@@ r@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ari@@ es in all of E@@ uro@@ pe@@ ."
I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , is@@ n't a th@@ riv@@ ing bi@@ r@@ d po@@ pul@@ ation like the last thing you want on a fi@@ s@@ h far@@ m@@ ?"
He sh@@ oo@@ k his he@@ ad@@ , no.
He said, "@@ We far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y, not int@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y.
This is an e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical net@@ wor@@ k.
The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p@@ .
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
So the p@@ in@@ k@@ er the bell@@ y, the better the system@@ ."
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, so let@@ 's re@@ vi@@ e@@ w@@ : a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s, and a far@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s its succ@@ ess on the he@@ alt@@ h of its pre@@ d@@ ator@@ s.
A fi@@ s@@ h far@@ m@@ , but also a bi@@ r@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ h, and by the way, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, they sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't even be there in the first plac@@ e.
They b@@ ro@@ od in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 mi@@ les a@@ way, where the so@@ il con@@ dit@@ ions are better for buil@@ ding n@@ est@@ s.
E@@ very mor@@ n@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les into the far@@ m@@ . And every ev@@ en@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les bac@@ k.
They do that because they're able to fo@@ ll@@ ow the b@@ ro@@ k@@ en wh@@ ite l@@ ine of hi@@ gh@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2@@ .
N@@ o ki@@ d@@ d@@ ing.
I was imag@@ in@@ ing a "@@ Mar@@ ch of the Pen@@ gu@@ in@@ s@@ " thing@@ , so I loo@@ ked at M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ .
I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les to the far@@ m@@ , and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les back at ni@@ ght@@ ?
D@@ o they do that for the chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ?"
He loo@@ ked at me like I had just qu@@ ot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on son@@ g@@ .
He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the f@@ oo@@ d@@ 's bet@@ ter@@ ."
I didn't ment@@ ion the s@@ k@@ in of my be@@ lo@@ v@@ ed fi@@ sh@@ , which was de@@ l@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don't like fi@@ s@@ h s@@ kin@@ ;
I don't like it se@@ ar@@ ed, I don't like it c@@ ri@@ sp@@ y.
It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, t@@ ar@@ -@@ like f@@ lavor@@ .
I al@@ most never co@@ ok with it.
Y@@ et@@ , when I ta@@ st@@ ed it at that rest@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, it ta@@ st@@ ed not at all like fi@@ s@@ h s@@ kin@@ .
It ta@@ st@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and c@@ le@@ an, like you were ta@@ king a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an@@ .
I ment@@ ion@@ ed that to M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , and he no@@ d@@ de@@ d.
He said, "@@ The s@@ k@@ in ac@@ ts like a spon@@ g@@ e.
It's the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se befor@@ e any@@ thing ent@@ ers the bod@@ y.
It evol@@ v@@ ed to so@@ a@@ k up imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ But our wat@@ er has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
OK@@ . A far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its fi@@ sh@@ ,
a far@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ d@@ ator@@ s.
And then I re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed when he sa@@ ys, "@@ A far@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ," he made a big underst@@ at@@ ement@@ , because the wat@@ er that f@@ low@@ s through that far@@ m comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r R@@ i@@ ver@@ . It's a riv@@ er that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s ten@@ d to car@@ ry these da@@ y@@ s@@ : ch@@ em@@ ical cont@@ am@@ in@@ ant@@ s, p@@ est@@ ici@@ de r@@ un@@ off@@ .
And when it wor@@ ks its way through the sy@@ ste@@ m and le@@ av@@ es, the wat@@ er is c@@ le@@ an@@ er than when it ent@@ er@@ ed.
The sy@@ ste@@ m is so he@@ al@@ th@@ y, it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the wat@@ er.
So, not just a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s, not just a far@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s its succ@@ ess by the he@@ alt@@ h of its pre@@ d@@ ator@@ s, but a far@@ m that's lit@@ er@@ ally a wat@@ er pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those fi@@ sh@@ , but for you and me as w@@ ell@@ .
Because when that wat@@ er le@@ av@@ es, it du@@ m@@ p@@ s out into the A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ ic@@ .
A d@@ ro@@ p in the oce@@ an, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you@@ , because this lo@@ ve stor@@ y, h@@ ow@@ ever ro@@ man@@ tic@@ , is also in@@ struc@@ tiv@@ e.
You might say it's a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for the fut@@ ure of good f@@ oo@@ d, wh@@ ether we're tal@@ king about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le.
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new con@@ ce@@ p@@ tion of ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, one in which the f@@ ood actually ta@@ st@@ es go@@ o@@ d.
But for a lot peopl@@ e, that's a bit to@@ o ra@@ dic@@ al.
We@@ 're not re@@ al@@ ist@@ s, us f@@ oo@@ di@@ es@@ ;
we're lo@@ ver@@ s.
We lo@@ ve far@@ mer@@ s@@ ' mark@@ et@@ s,
we lo@@ ve sm@@ all fam@@ il@@ y far@@ m@@ s,
we talk about lo@@ ca@@ l f@@ oo@@ d,
we e@@ at org@@ an@@ ic@@ .
And when you su@@ gg@@ est these are the things that will en@@ su@@ re the fut@@ ure of good f@@ oo@@ d, some@@ one, some@@ where st@@ and@@ s up and sa@@ ys, "@@ H@@ ey gu@@ y, I lo@@ ve p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, but how are you going to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?"
How are you going to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?
C@@ an I be h@@ on@@ est@@ ?
I don't lo@@ ve that question@@ .
N@@ o, not because we al@@ read@@ y produc@@ e en@@ ou@@ gh cal@@ ori@@ es to more than fe@@ ed the world.
O@@ ne bi@@ ll@@ ion people will go h@@ un@@ gr@@ y to@@ da@@ y.
O@@ ne bi@@ ll@@ ion -- that's more than ever befor@@ e -- because of gro@@ s@@ s in@@ e@@ qual@@ iti@@ es in di@@ stri@@ b@@ ut@@ ion@@ , not t@@ on@@ n@@ ag@@ e.
Now, I don't lo@@ ve this quest@@ ion because it's de@@ termin@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our f@@ ood sy@@ ste@@ m for the last 50 year@@ s.
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es, p@@ est@@ ic@@ ide@@ s to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s, ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il@@ , ch@@ ick@@ en to fi@@ sh@@ , and all al@@ ong ag@@ ri@@ busin@@ ess has sim@@ pl@@ y as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ If we're fe@@ ed@@ ing more people more ch@@ ea@@ pl@@ y, how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be@@ ?"
That's been the mo@@ tiv@@ ation,
it's been the j@@ ust@@ ific@@ ation@@ :
it's been the busin@@ ess pl@@ an of Americ@@ an ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re.
We should call it what it is@@ : a busin@@ ess in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation, a busin@@ ess that's qu@@ ick@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical cap@@ it@@ al that ma@@ kes that very produc@@ tion possi@@ bl@@ e.
That's not a busin@@ es@@ s, and it is@@ n't ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re.
O@@ u@@ r bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to@@ da@@ y, not because of di@@ min@@ i@@ sh@@ ing sup@@ pl@@ y, but because of di@@ min@@ i@@ sh@@ ing re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es. No@@ t by the lat@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or invent@@ ion@@ , but by fer@@ ti@@ le l@@ and@@ ; not by pu@@ m@@ p@@ s, but by fre@@ s@@ h wat@@ er@@ ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by for@@ est@@ s@@ ; and not by fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and net@@ s, but by fi@@ s@@ h in the se@@ a.
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?
L@@ et@@ 's start by as@@ k@@ ing@@ : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ?
O@@ r bet@@ ter@@ : How can we cre@@ ate con@@ dit@@ ions that en@@ able every commun@@ ity to fe@@ ed it@@ self@@ ?
T@@ o do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ busin@@ ess mo@@ del for the fut@@ u@@ re.
It's really ol@@ d, and it's ti@@ re@@ d.
It's hi@@ gh on cap@@ it@@ al, ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y and ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es, and it's never produc@@ ed any@@ thing really good to e@@ at@@ .
In@@ ste@@ ad@@ , let@@ 's look to the e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical mo@@ de@@ l@@ .
That's the one that re@@ li@@ es on two bi@@ ll@@ ion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ jo@@ b ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
L@@ oo@@ k to M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , far@@ mer@@ s like M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ . F@@ ar@@ m@@ s that ar@@ en@@ 't worl@@ ds un@@ to them@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ; far@@ m@@ s that rest@@ ore in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ pl@@ et@@ e@@ ; far@@ m@@ s that far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely in@@ ste@@ ad of just int@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ ; far@@ mer@@ s that are not just produc@@ er@@ s, but ex@@ per@@ ts in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s. Because they're the on@@ es that are ex@@ per@@ ts in f@@ lavor@@ , to@@ o.
And if I'm going to be really h@@ on@@ est@@ , they're a better ch@@ e@@ f than I'll ever b@@ e.
You know, I'm o@@ k@@ a@@ y with that, because if that's the fut@@ ure of good f@@ oo@@ d, it's going to be de@@ l@@ ici@@ ou@@ s.
Thank you.
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of sci@@ ence fic@@ tion@@ .
In hi@@ gh sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , I to@@ ok a bu@@ s to sch@@ oo@@ l an h@@ our each way every da@@ y.
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ed in a bo@@ o@@ k, sci@@ ence fic@@ tion bo@@ o@@ k, which to@@ ok my min@@ d to other worl@@ d@@ s, and s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed, in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form@@ , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sen@@ se of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity that I h@@ ad@@ .
And you know, that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity also man@@ if@@ est@@ ed it@@ sel@@ f in the fac@@ t that wh@@ en@@ ever I was@@ n't in sch@@ oo@@ l I was out in the w@@ oo@@ d@@ s, hi@@ king and ta@@ king "@@ s@@ am@@ pl@@ es@@ " -- fro@@ g@@ s and s@@ n@@ a@@ kes and bu@@ g@@ s and p@@ on@@ d wat@@ er -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it bac@@ k, looking at it un@@ der the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ sco@@ p@@ e.
You know, I was a real sci@@ ence ge@@ e@@ k.
But it was all about trying to underst@@ and the worl@@ d, underst@@ and the lim@@ its of possibi@@ lit@@ y.
And my lo@@ ve of sci@@ ence fic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed mi@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the l@@ ate '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ an@@ s. J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was com@@ ing into our liv@@ ing ro@@ om@@ s with his am@@ az@@ ing speci@@ als that show@@ ed us anim@@ als and plac@@ es and a won@@ d@@ ro@@ us world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly imag@@ in@@ ed.
So, that se@@ em@@ ed to re@@ son@@ ate with the whole sci@@ ence fic@@ tion part of it.
And I was an arti@@ st@@ .
I could d@@ ra@@ w. I could pa@@ int@@ .
And I f@@ ound that because there w@@ er@@ en@@ 't vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and this s@@ atur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ vi@@ es and all of this imag@@ er@@ y in the medi@@ a l@@ and@@ s@@ cap@@ e, I had to cre@@ ate these imag@@ es in my he@@ ad@@ .
You know, we all di@@ d, as ki@@ ds hav@@ ing to re@@ ad a bo@@ o@@ k, and through the au@@ th@@ or@@ 's de@@ script@@ ion@@ , put something on the mo@@ vi@@ e sc@@ re@@ en in our he@@ ad@@ s.
And so, my respon@@ se to this was to pa@@ int@@ , to d@@ ra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ atu@@ re@@ s, ali@@ en worl@@ d@@ s, ro@@ bot@@ s, sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p@@ s, all that stu@@ ff@@ .
I was end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly gett@@ ing bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h c@@ las@@ s do@@ o@@ d@@ l@@ ing be@@ h@@ in@@ d the t@@ ex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ k.
That was -- the cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y had to find its out@@ le@@ t some@@ h@@ ow@@ .
And an interest@@ ing thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u show@@ s actually got me very ex@@ cit@@ ed about the fac@@ t that there was an ali@@ en world right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p som@@ ed@@ a@@ y --
that se@@ em@@ ed pre@@ tt@@ y dar@@ n un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ , that was as ric@@ h and ex@@ o@@ ti@@ c as any@@ thing that I had imag@@ in@@ ed from read@@ ing these bo@@ o@@ k@@ s.
So, I deci@@ ded I was going to be@@ come a scu@@ b@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .
And the only prob@@ le@@ m with that was that I liv@@ ed in a little vi@@ ll@@ age in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a, 6@@ 00 mi@@ les from the ne@@ ar@@ est oce@@ an@@ .
But I didn't le@@ t that da@@ un@@ t me.
I p@@ est@@ er@@ ed my fa@@ ther un@@ ti@@ l he fin@@ ally f@@ ound a scu@@ b@@ a c@@ las@@ s in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Y@@ or@@ k, right ac@@ ros@@ s the bor@@ der from where we liv@@ e.
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ o@@ l at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of w@@ int@@ er in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Y@@ or@@ k.
And I didn't see the oce@@ an, a real oce@@ an, for another two year@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l we mov@@ ed to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a.
S@@ in@@ ce th@@ en, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 4@@ 0 year@@ s, I've spen@@ t about 3@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s under@@ wat@@ er, and 5@@ 00 h@@ our@@ s of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es.
And I've lear@@ ned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ , and even the sh@@ al@@ low oce@@ an@@ s, are so ric@@ h with am@@ az@@ ing life that really is be@@ y@@ on@@ d our imag@@ in@@ ation.
N@@ atu@@ re@@ 's imag@@ in@@ ation is so bo@@ un@@ d@@ l@@ ess com@@ par@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imag@@ in@@ ation.
I st@@ ill@@ , to this da@@ y, st@@ and in ab@@ solut@@ e a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ v@@ es.
And my lo@@ ve aff@@ ai@@ r with the oce@@ an is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as str@@ ong as it ever was@@ .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t, it was fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ing.
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the b@@ est way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stori@@ es with my ur@@ g@@ es to cre@@ ate imag@@ es.
And I was@@ , as a ki@@ d, con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing com@@ ic bo@@ o@@ k@@ s, and so on.
So, fil@@ m@@ ma@@ king was the way to put pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s and stori@@ es
tog@@ e@@ ther@@ , and that made sen@@ s@@ e.
And of cour@@ se the stori@@ es that I ch@@ ose to tell were sci@@ ence fic@@ tion stori@@ es@@ : "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ ator@@ ," "@@ A@@ li@@ en@@ s@@ " and "@@ The A@@ b@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ."
And with "@@ The A@@ b@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ," I was p@@ ut@@ ting tog@@ ether my lo@@ ve of under@@ wat@@ er and di@@ v@@ ing with fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ing.
So, you know, mer@@ g@@ ing the two pas@@ sion@@ s.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing interest@@ ing came out of "@@ The A@@ b@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ ," which was that to sol@@ ve a speci@@ fi@@ c n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative prob@@ le@@ m on that fil@@ m@@ , which was to cre@@ ate this kind of li@@ qui@@ d wat@@ er cre@@ atu@@ re, we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation, C@@ G@@ .
And this re@@ sul@@ ted in the first so@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ sur@@ fac@@ e ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ , C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a mo@@ vi@@ e.
And even thou@@ gh the fil@@ m didn't make any mon@@ ey -- bar@@ ely b@@ ro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ ness@@ ed something am@@ az@@ ing, which is that the au@@ di@@ enc@@ e, the glob@@ al au@@ di@@ enc@@ e, was m@@ es@@ mer@@ i@@ z@@ ed by this ap@@ par@@ ent mag@@ ic@@ .
You know, it's A@@ r@@ th@@ u@@ r C@@ lar@@ k@@ e's la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent@@ ly ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed technolo@@ gy is indi@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ i@@ sh@@ able from mag@@ ic@@ .
They were se@@ e@@ ing something mag@@ ic@@ al.
And so that got me very ex@@ cit@@ ed.
And I thou@@ ght, "@@ W@@ o@@ w, this is something that ne@@ ed@@ s to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ ati@@ c ar@@ t@@ ."
So, with "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2@@ ," which was my next fil@@ m@@ , we to@@ ok that much far@@ ther@@ .
W@@ or@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we cre@@ ated the li@@ qui@@ d met@@ al du@@ de in that fil@@ m@@ . The succ@@ ess h@@ un@@ g in the b@@ al@@ ance on wh@@ ether that eff@@ ec@@ t would wor@@ k.
And it di@@ d, and we cre@@ ated ma@@ gi@@ c again@@ ,
and we had the same re@@ sul@@ t with an au@@ di@@ ence --
al@@ thou@@ gh we did make a little more mon@@ ey on that one.
So, d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing a l@@ ine through those two do@@ ts of ex@@ peri@@ ence came to, "@@ This is going to be a whole new worl@@ d@@ ," this was a whole new world of cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y for fil@@ m arti@@ st@@ s.
So, I started a comp@@ any with St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on, my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on, who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ atu@@ re design@@ er at that time, and it was called D@@ ig@@ it@@ al D@@ o@@ ma@@ in.
And the con@@ ce@@ p@@ t of the comp@@ any was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g pas@@ t the an@@ al@@ o@@ g proc@@ es@@ se@@ s of op@@ tic@@ al pr@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to di@@ g@@ it@@ al produc@@ tion@@ .
And we actually did that and it g@@ ave us a comp@@ et@@ iti@@ ve ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age for a wh@@ il@@ e.
But we f@@ ound our@@ sel@@ ves l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing in the mi@@ d '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ atu@@ re and ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter design stu@@ f@@ f that we had actually f@@ oun@@ ded the comp@@ any to do.
So, I w@@ ro@@ te this pi@@ ece called "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was me@@ ant to ab@@ solut@@ ely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ velo@@ p@@ e of vi@@ su@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, of C@@ G eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, be@@ y@@ on@@ d, with re@@ al@@ ist@@ ic human em@@ o@@ ti@@ ve ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ , and the ma@@ in ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s would all be in C@@ G@@ , and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .
And the en@@ velo@@ p@@ e p@@ us@@ h@@ ed bac@@ k,
and I was t@@ old by the f@@ ol@@ ks at my comp@@ any that we w@@ er@@ en@@ 't going to be able to do this for a wh@@ il@@ e.
So, I sh@@ el@@ v@@ ed it, and I made this other mo@@ vi@@ e about a big shi@@ p that sin@@ k@@ s.
You know, I went and p@@ it@@ ch@@ ed it to the studi@@ o as "@@ '@@ R@@ om@@ e@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ :
"@@ It's going to be this e@@ pi@@ c ro@@ man@@ c@@ e, pas@@ sion@@ ate fil@@ m@@ ."
S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ c@@ k of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And that's the tr@@ u@@ th@@ . Now, the studi@@ o didn't know that.
But I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed them. I said, "@@ We@@ 're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ c@@ k. We@@ 're going to fil@@ m it for re@@ al.
We@@ 'll be us@@ ing it in the op@@ en@@ ing of the fil@@ m@@ .
It will be really import@@ ant@@ . It will be a great mark@@ et@@ ing h@@ oo@@ k@@ ."
And I tal@@ ked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ dit@@ ion@@ .
S@@ oun@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y. But this go@@ es back to that them@@ e about your imag@@ in@@ ation cre@@ ating a re@@ al@@ ity.
Because we actually cre@@ ated a re@@ al@@ ity where si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s lat@@ er, I find m@@ y@@ sel@@ f in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a h@@ al@@ f mi@@ les down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ ic@@ , looking at the real T@@ it@@ ani@@ c through a vi@@ e@@ w port@@ . No@@ t a mo@@ vi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for re@@ al.
Now, that b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d.
And it to@@ ok a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation, we had to buil@@ d cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ gh@@ ts and all kin@@ ds of thing@@ s.
B@@ ut@@ , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ v@@ e, these de@@ ep di@@ v@@ es, was like a sp@@ ace mis@@ sion@@ .
You know, where it was hi@@ gh@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ic@@ al, and it re@@ qui@@ red en@@ or@@ m@@ ous pl@@ ann@@ ing.
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le, you go down to this dar@@ k h@@ o@@ st@@ ile en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment where there is no h@@ op@@ e of re@@ sc@@ ue if you can't get back by you@@ r@@ self@@ .
And I thought lik@@ e, "@@ W@@ ow@@ . I'm lik@@ e, liv@@ ing in a sci@@ ence fic@@ tion mo@@ vi@@ e.
This is really co@@ ol@@ ."
And so, I really got b@@ it@@ t@@ en by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation.
O@@ f cour@@ se, the cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y, the sci@@ ence comp@@ on@@ ent of it --
it was every@@ thing. It was ad@@ vent@@ u@@ re,
it was cu@@ ri@@ os@@ it@@ y, it was imag@@ in@@ ation.
And it was an ex@@ peri@@ ence that H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ w@@ ood coul@@ dn't give me.
Be@@ caus@@ e, you know, I could imag@@ ine a cre@@ atu@@ re and we could cre@@ ate a vi@@ su@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t for it. But I coul@@ dn't imag@@ ine what I was se@@ e@@ ing out that w@@ in@@ do@@ w.
A@@ s we did some of our sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ dit@@ ion@@ s, I was se@@ e@@ ing cre@@ atu@@ re@@ s at h@@ y@@ d@@ ro@@ ther@@ ma@@ l vent@@ s and som@@ et@@ im@@ es things that I had never se@@ en befor@@ e, som@@ et@@ im@@ es things that no one had se@@ en befor@@ e, that actually were not de@@ scri@@ b@@ ed by sci@@ ence at the time that we sa@@ w them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was complet@@ ely sm@@ it@@ t@@ en by this, and had to do mor@@ e.
And so, I actually made a kind of cu@@ ri@@ ous deci@@ sion@@ .
Af@@ ter the succ@@ ess of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "@@ OK@@ , I'm going to par@@ k my day jo@@ b as a H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ w@@ ood mo@@ vi@@ e ma@@ k@@ er, and I'm going to go be a fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er for a wh@@ il@@ e@@ ."
And so, we started pl@@ ann@@ ing these ex@@ pe@@ dit@@ ion@@ s.
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing it with ro@@ bo@@ ti@@ c ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
We went back to the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c w@@ re@@ c@@ k.
We to@@ ok little bot@@ s that we had cre@@ ated that s@@ po@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ ve@@ y of that shi@@ p@@ , which had never been don@@ e.
No@@ body had ever loo@@ ked insi@@ de the w@@ re@@ c@@ k. They didn't have the mean@@ s to do it, so we cre@@ ated technolo@@ gy to do it.
So, you know, here I am no@@ w, on the de@@ c@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ , sit@@ ting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ e, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I k@@ new that the b@@ and had pla@@ y@@ ed.
And I'm fl@@ ying a little ro@@ bo@@ ti@@ c ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ do@@ r of the shi@@ p@@ .
When I say, "@@ I'm oper@@ ating it@@ ," but my min@@ d is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le.
I fel@@ t like I was ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally pres@@ ent insi@@ de the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ c@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u ex@@ peri@@ ence I've ever h@@ ad@@ , because I would know befor@@ e I tur@@ ned a cor@@ n@@ er what was going to be there befor@@ e the li@@ gh@@ ts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it, because I had w@@ al@@ ked the se@@ t for mon@@ th@@ s when we were ma@@ king the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And the se@@ t was bas@@ ed as an ex@@ ac@@ t re@@ pl@@ ica on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ pr@@ int@@ s of the shi@@ p@@ .
So, it was this ab@@ solut@@ ely re@@ mark@@ able ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
And it really made me re@@ ali@@ ze that the tele@@ pres@@ ence ex@@ peri@@ ence -- that you actually can have these ro@@ bo@@ ti@@ c av@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ n@@ ess is in@@ jec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le, into this other for@@ m of ex@@ ist@@ enc@@ e.
It was re@@ ally, really qu@@ ite prof@@ oun@@ d.
And it may be a little bit of a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some de@@ ca@@ de@@ s out as we start to have c@@ y@@ bor@@ g bo@@ di@@ es for ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation or for other mean@@ s in many sort of post@@ -@@ human fut@@ u@@ re@@ s that I can imag@@ in@@ e, as a sci@@ ence fic@@ tion f@@ an@@ .
So, hav@@ ing d@@ one these ex@@ pe@@ dit@@ ion@@ s, and really be@@ gin@@ ning to ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate what was down ther@@ e, su@@ ch as at the de@@ ep oce@@ an vent@@ s where we had these am@@ az@@ ing, am@@ az@@ ing anim@@ als --
they're bas@@ ically ali@@ en@@ s right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
They li@@ ve in an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment of ch@@ em@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is.
They don't sur@@ vi@@ ve on s@@ un@@ li@@ ght@@ -@@ bas@@ ed sy@@ ste@@ m the way we do.
And so, you're se@@ e@@ ing anim@@ als that are liv@@ ing next to a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de wat@@ er pl@@ um@@ es.
You think they can't possi@@ b@@ ly ex@@ ist@@ .
A@@ t the same time I was gett@@ ing very interest@@ ed in sp@@ ace sci@@ ence as w@@ ell -- again@@ , it's the sci@@ ence fic@@ tion inf@@ lu@@ enc@@ e, as a ki@@ d.
And I w@@ ound up gett@@ ing in@@ vol@@ v@@ ed with the sp@@ ace commun@@ it@@ y, really in@@ vol@@ v@@ ed with N@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ , sit@@ ting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y bo@@ ar@@ d, pl@@ ann@@ ing actu@@ al sp@@ ace mis@@ sion@@ s, going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ cos@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical pro@@ to@@ col@@ s, and all these sor@@ ts of thing@@ s, to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ n@@ ational sp@@ ace st@@ ation with our 3@@ D cam@@ era system@@ s.
And this was f@@ as@@ cin@@ at@@ ing.
But what I w@@ ound up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing sp@@ ace sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s with us into the de@@ ep@@ .
And ta@@ king them down so that they had acc@@ ess -- ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ olo@@ gi@@ st@@ s, plan@@ et@@ ary sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s, people who were interest@@ ed in these ex@@ tre@@ me en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ s -- ta@@ king them down to the vent@@ s, and l@@ ett@@ ing them se@@ e, and take s@@ am@@ pl@@ es and t@@ est in@@ stru@@ ment@@ s, and so on.
So, here we were ma@@ king do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ m@@ s, but actually doing sci@@ enc@@ e, and actually doing sp@@ ace sci@@ enc@@ e.
I'@@ d complet@@ ely clo@@ s@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the sci@@ ence fic@@ tion f@@ an, you know, as a ki@@ d, and doing this stu@@ f@@ f for re@@ al.
And you know, al@@ ong the way in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of dis@@ co@@ ver@@ y, I lear@@ ned a lo@@ t.
I lear@@ ned a lot about sci@@ enc@@ e. But I also lear@@ ned a lot about le@@ ad@@ er@@ shi@@ p@@ .
Now you think dire@@ c@@ t@@ or has got to be a le@@ ad@@ er, le@@ a@@ der of@@ , cap@@ ta@@ in of the shi@@ p@@ , and all that sort of thing.
I didn't really lear@@ n about le@@ ad@@ er@@ shi@@ p un@@ ti@@ l I did these ex@@ pe@@ dit@@ ion@@ s.
Because I had to, at a cer@@ ta@@ in po@@ int@@ , say, "@@ What am I doing out her@@ e?
Wh@@ y am I doing th@@ is@@ ? What do I get out of it@@ ?"
We don't make mon@@ ey at these d@@ am@@ n show@@ s.
We bar@@ ely bre@@ a@@ k ev@@ en@@ . There is no f@@ ame in it.
P@@ e@@ ople sort of think I went a@@ way between "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ a@@ il@@ s some@@ plac@@ e, sit@@ ting at the be@@ ach@@ .
M@@ ad@@ e all these fil@@ m@@ s, made all these do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ m@@ s for a very lim@@ it@@ ed au@@ di@@ enc@@ e.
N@@ o fam@@ e, no g@@ l@@ or@@ y, no mon@@ e@@ y. What are you do@@ ing@@ ?
Y@@ ou@@ 're doing it for the t@@ as@@ k it@@ self@@ , for the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge -- and the oce@@ an is the most ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of dis@@ co@@ ver@@ y, and for that str@@ ang@@ e b@@ on@@ d that happen@@ s when a sm@@ all gro@@ up of people for@@ m a ti@@ ght@@ ly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am@@ .
Because we would do these things with 1@@ 0@@ , 1@@ 2 peopl@@ e, wor@@ king for years at a time,
som@@ et@@ im@@ es at se@@ a for tw@@ o, three mon@@ th@@ s at a time.
And in that b@@ on@@ d, you re@@ ali@@ ze that the most important thing is the re@@ spe@@ c@@ t that you have for them and that they have for you@@ , that you@@ 've d@@ one a t@@ as@@ k that you can't ex@@ pla@@ in to some@@ one el@@ s@@ e.
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say, "@@ We had to do this, and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technolo@@ gy of it, and the diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ y, the hu@@ man@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce as@@ pe@@ c@@ ts of wor@@ king at se@@ a@@ ," you can't ex@@ pla@@ in it to peopl@@ e. It's that thing that ma@@ ybe co@@ p@@ s hav@@ e, or people in com@@ b@@ at that have g@@ one through something tog@@ ether and they know they can never ex@@ pla@@ in it.
C@@ re@@ at@@ es a b@@ on@@ d, cre@@ at@@ es a b@@ on@@ d of re@@ spe@@ c@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next mo@@ vi@@ e, which was "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tri@@ ed to ap@@ pl@@ y that same princi@@ p@@ le of le@@ ad@@ er@@ shi@@ p@@ , which is that you re@@ spe@@ c@@ t your te@@ am@@ , and you ear@@ n their re@@ spe@@ c@@ t in re@@ tur@@ n@@ .
And it really chang@@ ed the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic@@ .
So, here I was ag@@ a@@ in with a sm@@ all te@@ am@@ , in un@@ ch@@ ar@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y, doing "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," com@@ ing up with new technolo@@ gy that didn't ex@@ is@@ t befor@@ e.
T@@ rem@@ end@@ ous@@ ly ex@@ cit@@ ing.
T@@ rem@@ end@@ ous@@ ly ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing.
And we be@@ came a fam@@ il@@ y, over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f ye@@ ar peri@@ o@@ d.
And it complet@@ ely chang@@ ed how I do mo@@ vi@@ es.
So, people have com@@ ment@@ ed on h@@ o@@ w, "@@ Well, you know, you b@@ rou@@ ght back the oce@@ an org@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s and put them on the plan@@ et of P@@ and@@ or@@ a@@ ."
T@@ o me, it was more of a fun@@ d@@ ament@@ al way of doing busin@@ es@@ s, the proc@@ ess it@@ self@@ , that chang@@ ed as a re@@ sul@@ t of that.
So, what can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze out of all th@@ is@@ ?
You know, what are the l@@ es@@ son@@ s lear@@ ne@@ d@@ ?
Well, I think num@@ ber one is cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity.
It's the most pow@@ er@@ ful thing you ow@@ n@@ .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ if@@ est a re@@ al@@ ity.
And the re@@ spe@@ c@@ t of your te@@ am is more important than all the l@@ au@@ rel@@ s in the world.
I have y@@ oun@@ g fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ers come up to me and say, "@@ G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ v@@ ice for doing th@@ is@@ ."
And I say, "@@ D@@ on@@ 't put lim@@ it@@ ations on you@@ r@@ self@@ .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to you@@ r@@ self@@ , don't be@@ t again@@ st you@@ r@@ self@@ ,
and take ris@@ k@@ s@@ ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they lik@@ e: "@@ F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in ar@@ t and in ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation, because it's a le@@ a@@ p of f@@ ai@@ th@@ .
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that re@@ qui@@ red in@@ nov@@ ation was d@@ one with@@ out ris@@ k.
You have to be wi@@ ll@@ ing to take those ris@@ k@@ s.
So, that's the thought I would le@@ ave you with@@ , is that in wh@@ at@@ ever you're do@@ ing, fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion@@ , but fe@@ ar is no@@ t. Thank you.
If I can le@@ ave you with one big idea to@@ da@@ y, it's that the whole of the d@@ ata in which we con@@ su@@ me is gre@@ at@@ er that the su@@ m of the part@@ s, and in@@ ste@@ ad of thin@@ king about in@@ form@@ ation over@@ lo@@ ad@@ , what I'@@ d like you to think about is how we can use in@@ form@@ ation so that p@@ atter@@ n@@ s po@@ p and we can see tr@@ end@@ s that would other@@ wi@@ se be in@@ vi@@ si@@ bl@@ e.
So what we're looking at right here is a t@@ y@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ ar@@ t organi@@ z@@ ed by ag@@ e.
This to@@ o@@ l that I'm us@@ ing here is a little ex@@ per@@ iment@@ .
It's called P@@ i@@ v@@ ot@@ , and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can ch@@ oo@@ se to fil@@ ter in one partic@@ ul@@ ar cause of de@@ a@@ th@@ s -- say, acci@@ dent@@ s.
An@@ d, right a@@ way, I see there's a different p@@ atter@@ n that em@@ er@@ g@@ es.
This is be@@ caus@@ e, in the mi@@ d@@ -@@ are@@ a here, people are at their most ac@@ tiv@@ e, and over here they're at their most f@@ ra@@ il@@ .
We can ste@@ p back out ag@@ a@@ in and then re@@ organi@@ ze the d@@ ata by cause of de@@ a@@ th@@ , se@@ e@@ ing that cir@@ cul@@ ator@@ y di@@ se@@ as@@ es and can@@ c@@ er are the us@@ u@@ al s@@ us@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ s, but not for every@@ one.
If we go a@@ he@@ ad and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 4@@ 0 years or l@@ ess -- we see that acci@@ dent@@ s are actually the gre@@ at@@ est cause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed ab@@ ou@@ t.
And if you d@@ ri@@ ll into that, it's es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally the cas@@ e for men@@ .
So you get the idea that vi@@ e@@ w@@ ing in@@ form@@ ation, vi@@ e@@ w@@ ing d@@ ata in this way, is a lot like s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing in a liv@@ ing in@@ form@@ ation in@@ fo@@ -@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic@@ .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w dat@@ a, why not do it for cont@@ ent as w@@ ell@@ ?
So what we have right here is the co@@ ver of every sing@@ le S@@ port@@ s I@@ ll@@ u@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.
It's all her@@ e@@ ; it's all on the we@@ b@@ .
You can go back to your ro@@ om@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.
W@@ it@@ h P@@ i@@ v@@ ot@@ , you can d@@ ri@@ ll into a de@@ ca@@ de.
You can d@@ ri@@ ll into a partic@@ ul@@ ar year@@ .
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a speci@@ fi@@ c is@@ su@@ e.
So I'm looking at th@@ is@@ ; I see the a@@ th@@ let@@ es that have ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in this is@@ su@@ e, the s@@ port@@ s.
I'm a L@@ ance A@@ r@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an, so I'll go a@@ he@@ ad and I'll cl@@ ic@@ k on that, which re@@ ve@@ al@@ s, for me, all the is@@ su@@ es in which L@@ ance A@@ r@@ m@@ str@@ on@@ g@@ 's been a part of@@ .
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at th@@ es@@ e, I might thin@@ k, "@@ Well, what about ta@@ king a look at all of c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing@@ ?"
So I can ste@@ p bac@@ k, and ex@@ p@@ and on that.
And I see G@@ re@@ g L@@ e@@ M@@ on@@ d no@@ w.
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate over in@@ form@@ ation this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ er, b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not se@@ arch@@ ing, you're not b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing.
Y@@ ou@@ 're doing something that's actually a little bit differ@@ ent@@ .
It's in betwe@@ en, and we think it chang@@ es the way in@@ form@@ ation can be us@@ ed.
So I want to ex@@ tra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
What we're d@@ one here is we've ta@@ k@@ en every sing@@ le W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little su@@ m@@ mar@@ y. So the su@@ m@@ mar@@ y con@@ sist@@ s of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ si@@ s and an i@@ con to in@@ dic@@ ate the t@@ op@@ ical are@@ a that it comes fro@@ m@@ .
I'm only show@@ ing the to@@ p 5@@ 00 most po@@ pul@@ ar W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a pag@@ es right here.
But even in this lim@@ it@@ ed vi@@ e@@ w, we can do a lot of thing@@ s.
R@@ i@@ ght a@@ way, we get a sen@@ se of what are the t@@ op@@ ical do@@ ma@@ in@@ s that are most po@@ pul@@ ar on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a.
I'm going to go a@@ he@@ ad and sel@@ ec@@ t gover@@ n@@ ment@@ .
Now, hav@@ ing sel@@ ec@@ ted gover@@ n@@ ment@@ , I can now see that the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a cat@@ eg@@ ori@@ es that most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly cor@@ respon@@ d to that are T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine P@@ e@@ ople of the Y@@ ear@@ .
So this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not cont@@ ain@@ ed with@@ in any one W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a pag@@ e.
It's only possi@@ ble to see that insi@@ ght when you ste@@ p back and look at all of them.
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these partic@@ ul@@ ar su@@ m@@ m@@ ari@@ es, I can then d@@ ri@@ ll into the con@@ ce@@ p@@ t of T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ ,
br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them.
So looking at these peopl@@ e, I can see that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity come from gover@@ n@@ ment@@ ; some have come from natu@@ ral sci@@ enc@@ es@@ ; som@@ e, fe@@ w@@ er st@@ ill@@ , have come from busin@@ ess --
there's my b@@ os@@ s --
and one has come from mus@@ ic@@ .
And interest@@ ing@@ ly en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , B@@ ono is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ in@@ n@@ er.
So we can g@@ o, j@@ um@@ p@@ , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ in@@ ner@@ s.
So you se@@ e, we're n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it's actually a we@@ b@@ , not from pag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ pag@@ e, but at a hi@@ gh@@ er l@@ ev@@ el of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion@@ .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pri@@ s@@ e.
I'm just show@@ ing the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es we@@ b@@ s@@ ite here.
So P@@ i@@ v@@ ot@@ , this ap@@ plic@@ ation -- I don't want to call it a b@@ ro@@ w@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a b@@ ro@@ w@@ ser@@ , but you can vi@@ e@@ w we@@ b pag@@ es with it -- and we br@@ ing that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technolo@@ gy to every sing@@ le we@@ b p@@ age like this.
So I can ste@@ p bac@@ k, po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fi@@ c se@@ c@@ tion@@ . Now the reas@@ on why this is important is be@@ caus@@ e, by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vi@@ e@@ w@@ ing we@@ b pag@@ es in this way, I can look at my enti@@ re b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing h@@ ist@@ or@@ y in the ex@@ ac@@ t same wa@@ y.
So I can d@@ ri@@ ll into what I've d@@ one over speci@@ fi@@ c time f@@ ram@@ es.
H@@ ere, in fac@@ t, is the state of all the de@@ mo that I just g@@ av@@ e.
And I can sort of re@@ pla@@ y some stu@@ f@@ f that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er to@@ da@@ y.
An@@ d, if I want to ste@@ p back and look at every@@ thing@@ , I can s@@ l@@ ice and dice my h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, per@@ hap@@ s by my se@@ ar@@ ch h@@ ist@@ or@@ y --
here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ st@@ ic se@@ arch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for L@@ i@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ v@@ ot@@ .
And from th@@ es@@ e, I can d@@ ri@@ ll into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ un@@ ch them again@@ .
It's one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed m@@ ulti@@ p@@ le tim@@ es, and in each cas@@ e it ma@@ kes the whole gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts with the dat@@ a.
So right no@@ w, in this worl@@ d, we think about d@@ ata as being this cur@@ s@@ e.
We talk about the cur@@ se of in@@ form@@ ation over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .
We talk about d@@ ro@@ w@@ ning in dat@@ a.
What if we can actually tur@@ n that up@@ si@@ de down and tur@@ n the we@@ b up@@ si@@ de do@@ wn@@ , so that in@@ ste@@ ad of n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating from one thing to the nex@@ t, we get used to the h@@ abi@@ t of being able to go from many things to many thing@@ s, and then being able to see the p@@ atter@@ n@@ s that were other@@ wi@@ se hi@@ d@@ den@@ ?
If we can do that, then in@@ ste@@ ad of being tra@@ pp@@ ed in dat@@ a, we might actually ex@@ tr@@ ac@@ t in@@ form@@ ation.
An@@ d, in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ al@@ ing just with in@@ form@@ ation, we can te@@ ase out know@@ l@@ ed@@ g@@ e.
And if we get the know@@ l@@ ed@@ g@@ e, then ma@@ ybe even there's w@@ is@@ do@@ m to be f@@ oun@@ d.
So with that, I th@@ ank you.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body tal@@ ks about hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess these da@@ y@@ s.
I had some@@ body coun@@ t the num@@ ber of bo@@ o@@ ks with "@@ hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ " in the tit@@ le pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed in the last fi@@ ve years and they g@@ ave up after about 4@@ 0@@ , and there were many mor@@ e.
There is a hu@@ ge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, am@@ ong re@@ se@@ arch@@ er@@ s.
There is a lot of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess co@@ ach@@ ing.
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body would like to make people hap@@ pi@@ er.
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of wor@@ k, there are se@@ ver@@ al co@@ gn@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p@@ s that sort of make it al@@ most im@@ possi@@ ble to think stra@@ i@@ ght about hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ .
And my talk to@@ day will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these co@@ gn@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p@@ s.
This ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thin@@ king about their own hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, and it ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thin@@ king about hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, because it tur@@ n@@ s out we're just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body el@@ se is.
The first of these tra@@ p@@ s is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mi@@ t compl@@ ex@@ ity.
It tur@@ n@@ s out that the wor@@ d "@@ hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ " is just not a us@@ e@@ ful wor@@ d any@@ mor@@ e, because we ap@@ pl@@ y it to to@@ o many different thing@@ s.
I think there is one partic@@ ul@@ ar mean@@ ing to which we might re@@ str@@ ic@@ t it, but by and lar@@ g@@ e, this is something that we@@ 'll have to give up and we@@ 'll have to a@@ do@@ p@@ t the more com@@ plic@@ ated vi@@ e@@ w of what w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is.
The secon@@ d tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between ex@@ peri@@ ence and mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's between being hap@@ p@@ y in your lif@@ e, and being hap@@ p@@ y about your life or hap@@ p@@ y with your lif@@ e.
And those are two very different con@@ ce@@ pt@@ s, and they're bot@@ h lu@@ m@@ p@@ ed in the no@@ tion of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ .
And the th@@ ir@@ d is the f@@ oc@@ us@@ ing ill@@ u@@ sion@@ , and it's the un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate fac@@ t that we can't think about any cir@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ec@@ ts w@@ ell@@ -@@ being with@@ out di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ anc@@ e.
I mean@@ , this is a real co@@ gn@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p@@ .
Th@@ ere's just no way of gett@@ ing it ri@@ gh@@ t.
Now, I'@@ d like to start with an ex@@ amp@@ le of some@@ body who had a question@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ans@@ w@@ er s@@ essi@@ on after one of my l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re@@ s re@@ port@@ ed a stor@@ y,
and that was a stor@@ y -- He said he@@ '@@ d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y, and it was ab@@ solut@@ ely g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous mu@@ si@@ c and at the very end of the re@@ cor@@ d@@ ing, there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful sc@@ re@@ e@@ ch@@ ing so@@ un@@ d.
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, really qu@@ ite em@@ ot@@ ion@@ ally, it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
But it h@@ ad@@ n@@ '@@ t.
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ ori@@ es of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
He had had the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
He had had 20 min@@ ut@@ es of g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic@@ .
They coun@@ ted for no@@ thing because he was le@@ ft with a mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; the mem@@ or@@ y was ru@@ in@@ ed, and the mem@@ or@@ y was all that he had go@@ tt@@ en to ke@@ ep@@ .
What this is t@@ ell@@ ing us@@ , re@@ ally, is that we might be thin@@ king of our@@ sel@@ ves and of other people in ter@@ m@@ s of two sel@@ v@@ es.
There is an ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , who liv@@ es in the pres@@ ent and know@@ s the present@@ , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ liv@@ ing the p@@ ast@@ , but bas@@ ically it has only the present@@ .
It's the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f that the do@@ c@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es -- you know, when the do@@ c@@ t@@ or as@@ k@@ s, "@@ D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I t@@ ou@@ ch you her@@ e@@ ?"
And then there is a rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ or@@ e, and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ s the stor@@ y of our lif@@ e, and it's the one that the do@@ c@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question@@ , "@@ How have you been fe@@ el@@ ing lat@@ el@@ y@@ ?"
or "@@ How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a@@ ?" or something like that.
Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ iti@@ es, the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and gett@@ ing con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ .
Now, the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f is a stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er.
And that really star@@ ts with a b@@ a@@ si@@ c respon@@ se of our mem@@ ori@@ es -- it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.
We don't only tell stori@@ es when we se@@ t out to tell stori@@ es.
O@@ u@@ r mem@@ or@@ y t@@ ell@@ s us stori@@ es, that is, what we get to ke@@ ep from our ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es is a stor@@ y.
And le@@ t me be@@ g@@ in with one ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e.
This is an old stud@@ y.
Th@@ ose are actu@@ al p@@ ati@@ ent@@ s under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proc@@ ed@@ u@@ re.
I won@@ 't go into de@@ ta@@ il@@ . It's no lon@@ g@@ er pa@@ in@@ ful these da@@ ys, but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this stud@@ y was r@@ un in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s.
They were as@@ ked to re@@ por@@ t on their pa@@ in every 6@@ 0 secon@@ d@@ s.
H@@ ere are two p@@ ati@@ ent@@ s,
those are their re@@ cor@@ d@@ ing@@ s.
And you are as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ W@@ ho of them su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed mor@@ e@@ ?"
And it's a very e@@ as@@ y question@@ .
C@@ lear@@ ly, P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y was lon@@ g@@ er, and every min@@ ute of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A h@@ ad@@ , P@@ ati@@ ent B h@@ ad@@ , and mor@@ e.
But now there is another question@@ : "@@ How much did these p@@ ati@@ ent@@ s think they su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed@@ ?"
And here is a sur@@ pri@@ s@@ e. The sur@@ pri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ or@@ y of the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stori@@ es of the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es were differ@@ ent@@ , and because a very c@@ rit@@ ical part of the stor@@ y is how it end@@ s. And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stori@@ es is very in@@ spi@@ r@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ t@@ ly wor@@ se than the other@@ .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end@@ ;
it's a b@@ ad stor@@ y.
How do we know that@@ ?
Because we as@@ ked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y, and much lat@@ er, to@@ o, "@@ How b@@ ad was the whole thing@@ , in t@@ ot@@ al@@ ?"
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B@@ , in mem@@ or@@ y.
Now this is a dire@@ c@@ t con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
F@@ ro@@ m the po@@ int of vi@@ e@@ w of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , c@@ lear@@ ly, B had a wor@@ se time.
Now, what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A@@ , and we actually ra@@ n c@@ lin@@ ical ex@@ per@@ iment@@ s, and it has been don@@ e, and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ ten@@ d the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ p@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in with@@ out j@@ i@@ gg@@ l@@ ing it to@@ o mu@@ ch@@ .
That will cause the p@@ ati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er, but just a little and much l@@ ess than befor@@ e.
And if you do that for a co@@ up@@ le of min@@ ut@@ es, you have made the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off@@ , and you have the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off@@ , because now you have en@@ do@@ w@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better stor@@ y about his ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e.
What defin@@ es a stor@@ y@@ ?
And that is tr@@ ue of the stori@@ es that mem@@ or@@ y de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us@@ , and it's also tr@@ ue of the stori@@ es that we make up@@ . What defin@@ es a stor@@ y are chang@@ es, sign@@ ific@@ ant mom@@ ent@@ s and end@@ ing@@ s.
E@@ n@@ d@@ ing@@ s are ver@@ y, very important and, in this cas@@ e, the end@@ ing do@@ min@@ at@@ ed.
Now, the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f liv@@ es its life continu@@ ous@@ l@@ y.
It has mom@@ ent@@ s of ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e, one after the other@@ . And you can as@@ k@@ : What happen@@ s to these mom@@ ent@@ s@@ ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is really stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ war@@ d@@ :
They are lo@@ st for@@ ever@@ . I mean@@ , most of the mom@@ ent@@ s of our life -- and I c@@ alc@@ ul@@ at@@ ed, you know, the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical pres@@ ent is said to be about three secon@@ ds lon@@ g@@ ; that mean@@ s that, you know, in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them@@ ; in a mon@@ th@@ , there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don't le@@ ave a tr@@ ac@@ e.
M@@ os@@ t of them are complet@@ ely i@@ gn@@ or@@ ed by the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And y@@ et@@ , some@@ how you get the sen@@ se that they should coun@@ t, that what happen@@ s dur@@ ing these mom@@ ent@@ s of ex@@ peri@@ ence is our lif@@ e.
It's the fin@@ ite re@@ s@@ our@@ ce that we're spen@@ ding wh@@ ile we're on this ear@@ th@@ .
And how to spen@@ d it would se@@ e@@ m to be rel@@ ev@@ ant@@ , but that is not the stor@@ y that the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f ke@@ ep@@ s for us@@ .
So we have the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f and the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , and they're really qu@@ ite dist@@ inc@@ t.
The bi@@ gg@@ est differ@@ ence between them is in the h@@ and@@ l@@ ing of time.
F@@ ro@@ m the po@@ int of vi@@ e@@ w of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation, and the secon@@ d we@@ e@@ k is just as good as the fir@@ st@@ , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation.
That's not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
F@@ or the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , a tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ ori@@ es ad@@ de@@ d.
You have not chang@@ ed the stor@@ y.
And in this way, time is actually the c@@ rit@@ ical v@@ ari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ i@@ sh@@ es a rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f from an ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ;
time has very little imp@@ ac@@ t on the stor@@ y.
Now, the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f does more than rem@@ em@@ ber and tell stori@@ es.
It is actually the one that ma@@ kes deci@@ sion@@ s be@@ caus@@ e, if you have a p@@ ati@@ ent who has h@@ ad@@ , say, two col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ on@@ s and is deci@@ ding which of them to ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, then the one that ch@@ oo@@ se@@ s is the one that has the mem@@ or@@ y that is l@@ ess b@@ ad@@ , and that's the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en@@ .
The ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f has no vo@@ ice in this ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e.
We actually don't ch@@ oo@@ se between ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es, we ch@@ oo@@ se between mem@@ ori@@ es of ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es.
And even when we think about the fut@@ u@@ re, we don't think of our fut@@ ure nor@@ m@@ ally as ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es.
We think of our fut@@ ure as ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ated mem@@ ori@@ es.
And bas@@ ically you can look at this, you know, as a t@@ y@@ ran@@ n@@ y of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and you can think of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f sort of d@@ rag@@ g@@ ing the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f through ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es that the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f doesn't ne@@ ed.
I have that sen@@ se that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly the cas@@ e@@ ; that is, we go on v@@ ac@@ ation@@ s, to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent@@ , in the serv@@ ice of our rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And this is a bit h@@ ard to j@@ ust@@ if@@ y I thin@@ k.
I mean@@ , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our mem@@ ori@@ es@@ ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ v@@ en for the do@@ min@@ ance of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And when I think about that, I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ t@@ ica a few years ag@@ o, which was c@@ lear@@ ly the b@@ est v@@ ac@@ ation I've ever h@@ ad@@ , and I think of it rel@@ ativ@@ ely of@@ ten@@ , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ation@@ s.
And I prob@@ ably have con@@ su@@ m@@ ed my mem@@ ori@@ es of that thre@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k tri@@ p@@ , I would say, for about 2@@ 5 min@@ ut@@ es in the last f@@ our year@@ s.
Now, if I had ever op@@ en@@ ed the f@@ ol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s in it, I would have spen@@ t another h@@ our@@ . Now, that is three we@@ e@@ k@@ s, and that is at most an h@@ our and a h@@ al@@ f@@ . There se@@ em@@ s to be a disc@@ re@@ p@@ anc@@ y.
Now, I may be a bit ex@@ t@@ rem@@ e, you know, in how little ap@@ pet@@ ite I have for con@@ su@@ m@@ ing mem@@ ori@@ es, but even if you do more of this, there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question@@ :
Wh@@ y do we put so much we@@ i@@ ght on mem@@ or@@ y rel@@ ative to the we@@ i@@ ght that we put on ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es@@ ?
So I want you to think about a thought ex@@ per@@ iment@@ .
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation, you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tu@@ re@@ s will be de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed, and you@@ 'll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic d@@ ru@@ g so that you won@@ 't rem@@ em@@ ber any@@ thing.
Now, would you ch@@ oo@@ se the same v@@ ac@@ ation@@ ? And if you would ch@@ oo@@ se a different v@@ ac@@ ation, there is a con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between your two sel@@ v@@ es, and you need to think about how to ad@@ j@@ u@@ dic@@ ate that con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t, and it's actually not at all ob@@ vi@@ ou@@ s, because if you think in ter@@ m@@ s of time, then you get one ans@@ w@@ er,
and if you think in ter@@ m@@ s of mem@@ ori@@ es, you might get another ans@@ w@@ er.
Wh@@ y do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a prob@@ le@@ m that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a ch@@ o@@ ice between the two sel@@ v@@ es.
Now, the two sel@@ ves br@@ ing up two no@@ tion@@ s of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ .
There are really two con@@ ce@@ p@@ ts of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess that we can ap@@ pl@@ y, one per self@@ .
So you can as@@ k@@ : How hap@@ p@@ y is the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ?
And then you would as@@ k@@ : How hap@@ p@@ y are the mom@@ ent@@ s in the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ 's li@@ fe@@ ?
And they're all -- hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess for mom@@ ent@@ s is a f@@ air@@ ly com@@ plic@@ ated proc@@ ess@@ .
What are the em@@ ot@@ ions that can be me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ d@@ ?
An@@ d, by the way, now we are cap@@ able of gett@@ ing a pre@@ tt@@ y good idea of the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f over time.
If you as@@ k for the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , it's a complet@@ ely different thing.
This is not about how hap@@ pi@@ ly a per@@ son liv@@ es.
It is about how s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed or pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed the per@@ son is when that per@@ son thin@@ ks about her lif@@ e.
V@@ er@@ y different no@@ tion@@ .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn't dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h those no@@ tion@@ s is going to m@@ ess up the stud@@ y of hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, and I b@@ el@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of stu@@ dent@@ s of w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing, wh@@ o@@ 've been m@@ ess@@ ing up the stud@@ y of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess for a long time in pre@@ ci@@ se@@ ly this wa@@ y.
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f has been re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ z@@ ed in re@@ c@@ ent year@@ s, and there are now e@@ f@@ for@@ ts to me@@ as@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ el@@ y. The G@@ all@@ up O@@ r@@ g@@ ani@@ z@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than h@@ al@@ f a million people have been as@@ ked question@@ s about what they think of their life and about their ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es,
and there have been other e@@ f@@ for@@ ts al@@ ong those lin@@ es.
So in re@@ c@@ ent year@@ s, we have be@@ g@@ un to lear@@ n about the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the two sel@@ v@@ es.
And the ma@@ in l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have lear@@ ned is they are really differ@@ ent@@ .
You can know how s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed some@@ body is with their lif@@ e, and that really doesn't te@@ ach you much about how hap@@ pi@@ ly they're liv@@ ing their lif@@ e, and v@@ ice vers@@ a.
J@@ ust to give you a sen@@ se of the cor@@ rel@@ ation, the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5@@ .
What that mean@@ s is if you me@@ t some@@ bod@@ y, and you were t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ O@@ h his fa@@ ther is si@@ x fe@@ et t@@ all@@ ," how much would you know about his he@@ i@@ ght@@ ?
Well, you would know something about his he@@ i@@ ght, but there's a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y.
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y.
If I tell you that some@@ body ran@@ ked their life ei@@ ght on a sc@@ ale of ten@@ , you have a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y about how hap@@ p@@ y they are with their ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low@@ .
We know something about what contro@@ l@@ s s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess self@@ .
We know that mon@@ ey is very import@@ ant@@ , go@@ als are very import@@ ant@@ .
We know that hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with people that we lik@@ e, spen@@ ding time with people that we lik@@ e.
There are other pl@@ e@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s, but this is do@@ min@@ ant@@ .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the two sel@@ v@@ es, you are going to end up doing very different thing@@ s.
The bot@@ to@@ m l@@ ine of what I've said here is that we really should not think of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess as a sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute for w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
It is a complet@@ ely different no@@ tion@@ .
Now, very qu@@ ick@@ ly, another reas@@ on we can@@ not think stra@@ i@@ ght about hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about lif@@ e, and we actually liv@@ e.
So, if you as@@ k the sim@@ p@@ le quest@@ ion of how hap@@ p@@ y people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, you are not going to get to the cor@@ re@@ c@@ t ans@@ w@@ er.
When you as@@ k that question@@ , you think people m@@ ust be hap@@ pi@@ er in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a if@@ , say, you li@@ ve in O@@ hi@@ o.
And what happen@@ s is when you think about liv@@ ing in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, you are thin@@ king of the con@@ tras@@ t between C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and other plac@@ es, and that cont@@ ra@@ st@@ , say, is in c@@ li@@ mat@@ e.
Well, it tur@@ n@@ s out that c@@ lim@@ ate is not very important to the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f and it's not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve sel@@ f that deci@@ de@@ s how hap@@ p@@ y people are.
But no@@ w, because the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve sel@@ f is in ch@@ ar@@ g@@ e, you may end up -- some people may end up mov@@ ing to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a.
And it's sort of interest@@ ing to tr@@ ace what is going to hap@@ pe@@ n to people who mo@@ ve to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a in the h@@ op@@ e of gett@@ ing hap@@ pi@@ er.
Well, their ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing sel@@ f is not going to get hap@@ pi@@ er.
We know that.
But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are hap@@ pi@@ er, be@@ caus@@ e, when they think about it, they@@ 'll be re@@ min@@ ded of how h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o,
and they will fe@@ el they made the right deci@@ sion@@ .
It is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to think stra@@ i@@ ght about w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing, and I h@@ op@@ e I have gi@@ v@@ en you a sen@@ se of how diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t it is.
Thank you.
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. I've got a quest@@ ion for you.
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .
Now, when we were on the ph@@ one a few we@@ e@@ ks ag@@ o, you ment@@ ion@@ ed to me that there was qu@@ ite an interest@@ ing re@@ sul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y.
I@@ s that something you can sh@@ are sin@@ ce you do have a few mom@@ ent@@ s le@@ ft no@@ w@@ ?
D@@ ani@@ el K@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ : Su@@ re.
I think the most interest@@ ing re@@ sul@@ t that we f@@ ound in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y is a num@@ ber@@ , which we ab@@ solut@@ ely did not ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t to fin@@ d.
We f@@ ound that with re@@ spe@@ c@@ t to the hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ .
When we loo@@ ked at how fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s, v@@ ary with in@@ com@@ e. And it tur@@ n@@ s out that, be@@ low an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a year@@ , for Americ@@ an@@ s -- and that's a very lar@@ ge s@@ amp@@ le of Americ@@ an@@ s, like 6@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ , so it's a lar@@ ge re@@ present@@ ative s@@ amp@@ le -- be@@ low an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a year@@ ...
C@@ A@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ . D@@ K@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ . 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a year@@ , people are un@@ hap@@ p@@ y, and they get pro@@ gre@@ ssi@@ v@@ ely un@@ hap@@ pi@@ er the po@@ or@@ er they get@@ . A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an ab@@ solut@@ ely fl@@ at lin@@ e.
I me@@ an I've r@@ ar@@ ely se@@ en lin@@ es so fl@@ at@@ .
C@@ lear@@ ly, what is happen@@ ing is mon@@ ey does not bu@@ y you ex@@ peri@@ enti@@ al hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, but l@@ ac@@ k of mon@@ ey cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mi@@ ser@@ y, and we can me@@ as@@ ure that mi@@ ser@@ y ver@@ y, very c@@ lear@@ l@@ y.
In ter@@ m@@ s of the other self@@ , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , you get a different stor@@ y.
The more mon@@ ey you ear@@ n@@ , the more s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed you are.
That does not h@@ old for em@@ ot@@ ion@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : But D@@ ann@@ y, the whole Americ@@ an en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about lif@@ e, li@@ ber@@ t@@ y, the p@@ ur@@ su@@ it of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess@@ .
If people to@@ ok seri@@ ous@@ ly that fin@@ d@@ ing, I mean@@ , it se@@ em@@ s to tur@@ n up@@ si@@ de down every@@ thing we beli@@ eve ab@@ ou@@ t, like for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, ta@@ x@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y and so for@@ th@@ .
I@@ s there any ch@@ ance that polit@@ ici@@ an@@ s, that the coun@@ try gener@@ ally, would take a fin@@ ding like that seri@@ ous@@ ly and r@@ un pub@@ li@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y bas@@ ed on it@@ ?
D@@ K@@ : You know I think that there is re@@ co@@ gn@@ iti@@ on of the ro@@ le of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in pub@@ li@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y.
The re@@ co@@ gn@@ iti@@ on is going to be s@@ low in the Un@@ it@@ ed St@@ at@@ es, no quest@@ ion about that, but in the U@@ .@@ K@@ .@@ , it is happen@@ ing, and in other coun@@ tri@@ es it is happen@@ ing.
P@@ e@@ ople are re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ z@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thin@@ king of hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess when they think of pub@@ li@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y.
It's going to take a wh@@ il@@ e, and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate wh@@ ether they want to stud@@ y ex@@ peri@@ ence hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, or wh@@ ether they want to stud@@ y life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation, so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate f@@ air@@ ly so@@ on.
How to en@@ h@@ ance hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess go@@ es very different ways de@@ pen@@ ding on how you thin@@ k, and wh@@ ether you think of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f or you think of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ ing self@@ .
This is going to inf@@ lu@@ ence pol@@ ic@@ y, I thin@@ k, in years to com@@ e.
In the Un@@ it@@ ed St@@ at@@ es, e@@ f@@ for@@ ts are being made to me@@ as@@ ure the ex@@ peri@@ ence hap@@ p@@ in@@ ess of the po@@ pul@@ ation.
This is going to b@@ e, I thin@@ k, with@@ in the next de@@ ca@@ de or tw@@ o, part of n@@ ational st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : Well, it se@@ em@@ s to me that this is@@ su@@ e will -- or at le@@ ast should be -- the most interest@@ ing pol@@ ic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ac@@ k over the next few year@@ s.
Thank you so much for invent@@ ing be@@ hav@@ i@@ or@@ al econom@@ ic@@ s.
Thank you@@ , D@@ ann@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ .
I'm going to talk to@@ day about ener@@ gy and c@@ li@@ mat@@ e.
And that might se@@ e@@ m a bit sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ing because my fu@@ ll@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es and se@@ ed@@ s, about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and de@@ liv@@ er to hel@@ p the po@@ or@@ est two bi@@ ll@@ ion li@@ ve better liv@@ es.
But ener@@ gy and c@@ lim@@ ate are ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely important to these people -- in fac@@ t, more important than to any@@ one el@@ se on the plan@@ et@@ .
The c@@ lim@@ ate gett@@ ing wor@@ se mean@@ s that many year@@ s, their c@@ ro@@ p@@ s won@@ 't gro@@ w@@ :
There will be to@@ o much ra@@ in, not en@@ ou@@ gh ra@@ in,
things will change in ways that their f@@ ra@@ gi@@ le en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment sim@@ pl@@ y can't sup@@ port@@ .
And that le@@ ad@@ s to star@@ v@@ ation, it le@@ ad@@ s to un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y, it le@@ ad@@ s to un@@ rest@@ .
So, the c@@ lim@@ ate chang@@ es will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them.
Al@@ so, the p@@ ric@@ e of ener@@ gy is very important to them.
In fac@@ t, if you could pic@@ k just one thing to low@@ er the p@@ ric@@ e of@@ , to re@@ duc@@ e po@@ ver@@ t@@ y, by far you would pic@@ k ener@@ g@@ y.
Now, the p@@ ric@@ e of ener@@ gy has come down over time.
R@@ e@@ ally ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is bas@@ ed on ad@@ v@@ anc@@ es in ener@@ g@@ y.
The co@@ al re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ ,
and, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've se@@ en a very ra@@ pi@@ d de@@ cl@@ ine in the p@@ ric@@ e of el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ it@@ y, and that's why we have re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ ator@@ s, air@@ -@@ con@@ dit@@ ion@@ ing, we can make mo@@ der@@ n materi@@ als and do so many thing@@ s.
And so, we're in a won@@ der@@ ful s@@ itu@@ ation with el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity in the ric@@ h world.
B@@ ut@@ , as we make it ch@@ ea@@ per -- and let@@ 's go for ma@@ king it tw@@ ice as ch@@ ea@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ stra@@ int@@ , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
C@@ O@@ 2 is war@@ m@@ ing the plan@@ et@@ , and the e@@ qu@@ ation on C@@ O@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ war@@ d one.
If you su@@ m up the C@@ O@@ 2 that get@@ s em@@ it@@ t@@ ed, that le@@ ad@@ s to a tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re incre@@ as@@ e, and that tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re incre@@ ase le@@ ad@@ s to some very ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s@@ :
the eff@@ ec@@ ts on the we@@ a@@ ther@@ ; per@@ hap@@ s wor@@ se, the indi@@ re@@ c@@ t eff@@ ec@@ t@@ s, in that the natu@@ ral e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem@@ s can't ad@@ just to these ra@@ pi@@ d chang@@ es, and so you get e@@ cos@@ y@@ ste@@ m coll@@ ap@@ s@@ es.
Now, the ex@@ ac@@ t am@@ oun@@ t of how you ma@@ p from a cer@@ ta@@ in incre@@ ase of C@@ O@@ 2 to what tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re will be and where the positi@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are, there's some un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y ther@@ e, but not very mu@@ ch@@ .
And there's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly un@@ cer@@ ta@@ int@@ y about how b@@ ad those eff@@ ec@@ ts will b@@ e, but they will be ex@@ t@@ rem@@ ely b@@ ad@@ .
I as@@ ked the to@@ p sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s on this se@@ ver@@ al tim@@ es@@ : D@@ o we really have to get down to ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o?
C@@ an@@ 't we just c@@ ut it in h@@ al@@ f or a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is that un@@ ti@@ l we get ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o, the tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re will continu@@ e to ris@@ e.
And so that's a big ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
It's very different than sa@@ ying "@@ We@@ 're a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ hi@@ gh tr@@ uc@@ k trying to get un@@ der a ten@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t bri@@ d@@ g@@ e,
and we can just sort of s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze under@@ ."
This is something that has to get to z@@ er@@ o.
Now, we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de every year@@ , over 2@@ 6 bi@@ ll@@ ion t@@ on@@ s.
F@@ or each Americ@@ an, it's about 20 t@@ on@@ s@@ ;
for people in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es, it's l@@ ess than one t@@ on.
It's an aver@@ age of about fi@@ ve t@@ on@@ s for every@@ one on the plan@@ et@@ .
An@@ d, some@@ h@@ o@@ w, we have to make chang@@ es that will br@@ ing that down to z@@ er@@ o.
It's been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up@@ .
It's only v@@ ari@@ ous econom@@ ic chang@@ es that have even fl@@ att@@ en@@ ed it at all@@ , so we have to go from ra@@ pi@@ d@@ ly ris@@ ing to f@@ all@@ ing, and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to z@@ er@@ o.
This e@@ qu@@ ation has f@@ our fac@@ tor@@ s,
a little bit of m@@ ulti@@ plic@@ ation@@ :
So, you@@ 've got a thing on the le@@ f@@ t, C@@ O@@ 2@@ , that you want to get to z@@ er@@ o, and that's going to be bas@@ ed on the num@@ ber of peopl@@ e, the serv@@ ic@@ es each person@@ 's us@@ ing on aver@@ ag@@ e, the ener@@ gy on aver@@ age for each serv@@ ic@@ e, and the C@@ O@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of ener@@ g@@ y.
So, let@@ 's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ er@@ o.
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly, one of these num@@ ber@@ s is going to have to get pre@@ tt@@ y ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o.
Now that's back from hi@@ gh sch@@ oo@@ l al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra,
but let@@ 's take a loo@@ k.
F@@ ir@@ st@@ , we've got po@@ pul@@ ation.
The world to@@ day has 6@@ .@@ 8 bi@@ ll@@ ion peopl@@ e.
That's he@@ a@@ ded up to about n@@ ine bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ .
Now, if we do a really great jo@@ b on new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es, he@@ alt@@ h car@@ e, re@@ produc@@ ti@@ ve he@@ alt@@ h serv@@ ic@@ es, we could low@@ er that b@@ y, per@@ hap@@ s, 10 or 1@@ 5 per@@ cent@@ , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3@@ .
The secon@@ d fac@@ t@@ or is the serv@@ ic@@ es we us@@ e.
This en@@ comp@@ as@@ se@@ s every@@ thing@@ : the f@@ ood we e@@ at@@ , clo@@ thing@@ , T@@ V@@ , he@@ at@@ ing.
Th@@ ese are very good thing@@ s@@ : gett@@ ing ri@@ d of po@@ ver@@ t@@ y mean@@ s pro@@ vi@@ ding these serv@@ ic@@ es to al@@ most every@@ one on the plan@@ et@@ .
And it's a great thing for this num@@ ber to go up@@ .
In the ric@@ h worl@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s the to@@ p one bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ , we prob@@ ably could c@@ ut back and use l@@ es@@ s, but every year@@ , this num@@ ber@@ , on aver@@ ag@@ e, is going to go up@@ ,
and so, over all@@ , that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the serv@@ ic@@ es de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed per person@@ .
H@@ ere we have a very b@@ a@@ si@@ c serv@@ ic@@ e:
D@@ o you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your h@@ ou@@ se to be able to re@@ ad your hom@@ e@@ wor@@ k@@ ? An@@ d, in fac@@ t, these ki@@ ds don@@ '@@ t, so they're going out and read@@ ing their sch@@ oo@@ l work un@@ der the stre@@ et l@@ amp@@ s.
Now, eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y, E@@ , the ener@@ gy for each serv@@ ic@@ e, here fin@@ ally we have some good ne@@ w@@ s.
We have something that's not going up@@ .
Th@@ rou@@ gh v@@ ari@@ ous invent@@ ions and new ways of doing li@@ ght@@ ing, through different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of car@@ s, different ways of buil@@ ding buil@@ d@@ ing@@ s -- there are a lot of serv@@ ic@@ es where you can br@@ ing the ener@@ gy for that serv@@ ice down qu@@ ite sub@@ st@@ anti@@ all@@ y.
S@@ om@@ e indi@@ vidu@@ al serv@@ ic@@ es even br@@ ing it down by 9@@ 0 per@@ cent@@ .
There are other serv@@ ic@@ es like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er, or how we do ai@@ r trans@@ port@@ , where the ro@@ om@@ s for im@@ prov@@ em@@ ent are far@@ , far l@@ ess@@ .
And so, over@@ all here, if we're op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic@@ , we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ t@@ or of three to ev@@ en, per@@ hap@@ s, a fac@@ t@@ or of si@@ x@@ .
But for these first three fac@@ tor@@ s no@@ w, we've g@@ one from 2@@ 6 bi@@ ll@@ ion to, at b@@ est@@ , ma@@ ybe 1@@ 3 bi@@ ll@@ ion t@@ on@@ s,
and that just won@@ 't c@@ ut it.
So let@@ 's look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ t@@ or -- this is going to be a k@@ ey one -- and this is the am@@ oun@@ t of C@@ O@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of ener@@ g@@ y.
And so the quest@@ ion is@@ : C@@ an you actually get that to z@@ er@@ o?
If you b@@ ur@@ n co@@ al, no.
If you b@@ ur@@ n natu@@ ral g@@ as@@ , no.
Al@@ most every way we make el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity to@@ da@@ y, ex@@ ce@@ p@@ t for the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and n@@ uc@@ lear@@ , p@@ ut@@ s out C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
And so, what we're going to have to do at a glob@@ al sc@@ ale, is cre@@ ate a new system@@ .
And so, we need ener@@ gy mi@@ rac@@ l@@ es.
Now, when I use the ter@@ m "@@ mi@@ rac@@ le@@ ," I don't me@@ an something that's im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e.
The m@@ ic@@ ro@@ proc@@ ess@@ or is a mi@@ rac@@ le. The person@@ al computer is a mi@@ rac@@ le.
The Inter@@ ne@@ t and its serv@@ ic@@ es are a mi@@ rac@@ le.
So, the people here have partic@@ i@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ rac@@ l@@ es.
U@@ su@@ ally, we don't have a de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e, where you have to get the mi@@ rac@@ le by a cer@@ ta@@ in dat@@ e.
U@@ su@@ ally, you just kind of st@@ and b@@ y, and some come al@@ on@@ g@@ , some don@@ '@@ t.
This is a cas@@ e where we actually have to d@@ ri@@ ve at ful@@ l spe@@ ed and get a mi@@ rac@@ le in a pre@@ tt@@ y ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ in@@ e.
Now, I thou@@ ght, "@@ How could I really cap@@ ture th@@ is@@ ?
I@@ s there some kind of natu@@ ral ill@@ u@@ str@@ ation, some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b peopl@@ e's imag@@ in@@ ation her@@ e@@ ?"
I thought back to a ye@@ ar ag@@ o when I b@@ rou@@ ght mo@@ s@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s, and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that.
It really got them in@@ vol@@ v@@ ed in the idea of@@ , you know, there are people who li@@ ve with mo@@ s@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s.
So, with ener@@ g@@ y, all I could come up with is this.
I deci@@ ded that re@@ le@@ as@@ ing fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es would be my cont@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion to the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment here this year@@ .
So here we have some natu@@ ral fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es.
I'm t@@ old they don't b@@ it@@ e@@ ; in fac@@ t, they might not even le@@ ave that j@@ ar@@ .
Now, there's all sor@@ ts of gi@@ m@@ m@@ ick@@ y solut@@ ions like that one, but they don't really ad@@ d up to mu@@ ch@@ .
We need solut@@ ions -- ei@@ ther one or se@@ ver@@ al -- that have un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able re@@ li@@ abilit@@ y, and, al@@ thou@@ gh there's many dire@@ c@@ tion@@ s people are se@@ e@@ k@@ ing, I really only see fi@@ ve that can a@@ chi@@ eve the big num@@ ber@@ s.
I've le@@ ft out ti@@ de, ge@@ other@@ mal@@ , fu@@ sion@@ , bi@@ o@@ fu@@ el@@ s.
Th@@ ose may make some cont@@ ri@@ b@@ ut@@ ion@@ , and if they can do better than I ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t, so much the bet@@ ter@@ , but my k@@ ey po@@ int here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fi@@ v@@ e, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ t@@ ing, because they all have sign@@ ific@@ ant ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es.
L@@ et@@ 's look first at the b@@ ur@@ ning fos@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ s, ei@@ ther b@@ ur@@ ning co@@ al or b@@ ur@@ ning natu@@ ral g@@ as@@ .
What you need to do ther@@ e, se@@ em@@ s like it might be sim@@ pl@@ e, but it's no@@ t, and that's to take all the C@@ O@@ 2@@ , after you@@ 've b@@ ur@@ ned it, going out the f@@ lu@@ e, pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it, cre@@ ate a li@@ qui@@ d, put it some@@ wh@@ ere, and h@@ op@@ e it st@@ a@@ ys there.
Now we have some pi@@ lot things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent l@@ ev@@ el@@ , but gett@@ ing up to that ful@@ l per@@ cent@@ ag@@ e, that will be very tr@@ ick@@ y, and ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing on where these C@@ O@@ 2 qu@@ ant@@ iti@@ es should be put will be har@@ d,
but the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ est one here is this lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m is@@ su@@ e.
Wh@@ o@@ 's going to be su@@ re@@ ?
Wh@@ o@@ 's going to guar@@ ant@@ e@@ e something that is lit@@ er@@ ally bi@@ ll@@ ions of tim@@ es lar@@ g@@ er than any t@@ y@@ p@@ e of wa@@ st@@ e you think of in ter@@ m@@ s of n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar or other thing@@ s@@ ?
This is a lot of vol@@ um@@ e.
So that's a t@@ ou@@ gh one.
N@@ ex@@ t would be n@@ uc@@ lear@@ .
It also has three big problem@@ s@@ :
C@@ o@@ st@@ , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in hi@@ gh@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated coun@@ tri@@ es, is hi@@ gh@@ ;
the is@@ su@@ e of the sa@@ f@@ et@@ y, really fe@@ el@@ ing good about no@@ thing could go w@@ ron@@ g@@ , that, even thou@@ gh you have these human oper@@ ator@@ s, that the fu@@ el doesn't get used for we@@ ap@@ on@@ s.
And then what do you do with the wa@@ st@@ e?
An@@ d, al@@ thou@@ gh it's not very lar@@ g@@ e, there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ n@@ s about that.
P@@ e@@ ople need to fe@@ el good about it.
So three very t@@ ou@@ gh problem@@ s that might be sol@@ v@@ ab@@ le, and so, should be wor@@ ked on.
The last three of the fi@@ v@@ e, I've gro@@ up@@ ed tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
Th@@ ese are what people of@@ t@@ en re@@ f@@ er to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
And they actually -- al@@ thou@@ gh it's great they don't re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ ag@@ es.
O@@ ne is that the den@@ s@@ ity of ener@@ gy g@@ a@@ ther@@ ed in these technolo@@ gi@@ es is d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically l@@ ess than a pow@@ er pl@@ ant@@ .
This is ener@@ gy far@@ m@@ ing, so you're tal@@ king about many s@@ qu@@ are mi@@ l@@ es, thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of time more are@@ a than you think of as a nor@@ ma@@ l ener@@ gy pl@@ ant@@ .
Al@@ so, these are inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
The s@@ un doesn't sh@@ ine all da@@ y, it doesn't sh@@ ine every da@@ y, and, li@@ ke@@ w@@ is@@ e, the w@@ in@@ d doesn't blo@@ w all the time.
And so, if you de@@ pen@@ d on these s@@ our@@ c@@ es, you have to have some way of gett@@ ing the ener@@ gy dur@@ ing those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it's not av@@ a@@ il@@ ab@@ le.
So, we've got big cos@@ t ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es here,
we have trans@@ mi@@ ssi@@ on ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es@@ :
for ex@@ am@@ pl@@ e, say this ener@@ gy s@@ our@@ ce is out@@ si@@ de your coun@@ tr@@ y@@ ;
you not only need the technolo@@ g@@ y, but you have to de@@ al with the ris@@ k of the ener@@ gy com@@ ing from el@@ se@@ wh@@ er@@ e.
An@@ d, fin@@ ally, this stor@@ age problem@@ .
An@@ d, to dimen@@ sion@@ ali@@ ze this, I went through and loo@@ ked at all the t@@ y@@ p@@ es of b@@ atter@@ i@@ es that get made -- for car@@ s, for comput@@ er@@ s, for ph@@ on@@ es, for f@@ las@@ h@@ li@@ ght@@ s, for every@@ thing -- and com@@ par@@ ed that to the am@@ oun@@ t of el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ical ener@@ gy the world us@@ es, and what I f@@ ound is that all the b@@ atter@@ i@@ es we make now could st@@ ore l@@ ess than 10 min@@ ut@@ es of all the ener@@ g@@ y.
And so, in fac@@ t, we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here, something that's going to be a fac@@ t@@ or of 100 better than the ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es we have no@@ w.
It's not im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e, but it's not a very e@@ as@@ y thing.
Now, this show@@ s up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ce to be ab@@ ov@@ e, say, 20 to 3@@ 0 percent of what you're us@@ ing.
If you're coun@@ ting on it for 100 per@@ cent@@ , you need an incredi@@ ble mi@@ rac@@ le b@@ atter@@ y.
Now, how we're going to go for@@ war@@ d on this -- wh@@ at's the right ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ?
I@@ s it a M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an P@@ ro@@ jec@@ t@@ ? Wh@@ at's the thing that can get us ther@@ e?
Well, we need lo@@ ts of comp@@ ani@@ es wor@@ king on this, h@@ un@@ dre@@ d@@ s.
In each of these fi@@ ve pa@@ th@@ s, we need at le@@ ast a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d peopl@@ e.
And a lot of them@@ , you@@ 'll look at and say, "@@ Th@@ ey@@ 're c@@ ra@@ z@@ y@@ ." That's go@@ o@@ d.
An@@ d, I thin@@ k, here in the TED gro@@ up@@ , we have many people who are al@@ read@@ y p@@ ur@@ su@@ ing this.
B@@ ill G@@ ros@@ s has se@@ ver@@ al comp@@ ani@@ es, inc@@ lu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ ma@@ l technolo@@ gi@@ es.
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la@@ 's inv@@ est@@ ing in do@@ z@@ en@@ s of comp@@ ani@@ es that are doing great things and have interest@@ ing possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es, and I'm trying to hel@@ p back that.
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a comp@@ any that, per@@ hap@@ s sur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly, is actually ta@@ king the n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ .
There are some in@@ nov@@ ations in n@@ uc@@ lear@@ : mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar@@ , li@@ qui@@ d.
And in@@ nov@@ ation really st@@ op@@ p@@ ed in this indu@@ str@@ y qu@@ ite some ag@@ o, so the idea that there's some good ide@@ as la@@ ying around is not all that sur@@ pri@@ s@@ ing.
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er is that, in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ u@@ m -- the one per@@ cent@@ , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we deci@@ de@@ d, "@@ L@@ et@@ 's b@@ ur@@ n the 9@@ 9 per@@ cent@@ , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8@@ ." It is kind of a c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
In fac@@ t, people had tal@@ ked about it for a long time, but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly wh@@ ether it would work or no@@ t, and so it's through the ad@@ v@@ ent of mo@@ der@@ n super@@ comput@@ ers that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that, y@@ es, with the right materi@@ al@@ 's ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ , this loo@@ ks like it would wor@@ k.
An@@ d, because you're b@@ ur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 per@@ cent@@ , you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ prov@@ ed cos@@ t pro@@ fil@@ e.
You actually b@@ ur@@ n up the wa@@ st@@ e, and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ st@@ e from to@@ da@@ y@@ 's re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s. So, in@@ ste@@ ad of wor@@ r@@ ying about them@@ , you just take that. It's a great thing.
It bre@@ a@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ u@@ m as it go@@ es al@@ on@@ g@@ , so it's kind of like a c@@ and@@ le.
You can see it's a lo@@ g ther@@ e, of@@ t@@ en re@@ fer@@ red to as a tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing w@@ ave re@@ ac@@ tor@@ .
In ter@@ m@@ s of fu@@ el@@ , this really sol@@ ves the problem@@ .
I've got a pic@@ ture here of a pl@@ ace in K@@ ent@@ uc@@ k@@ y.
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ , the 9@@ 9 per@@ cent@@ , where they@@ 've ta@@ k@@ en out the part they b@@ ur@@ n no@@ w, so it's called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um@@ .
That would pow@@ er the U@@ .@@ S@@ . for h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of year@@ s.
An@@ d, sim@@ pl@@ y by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ wat@@ er in an in@@ ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve proc@@ es@@ s, you@@ '@@ d have en@@ ou@@ gh fu@@ el for the enti@@ re lif@@ et@@ im@@ e of the re@@ st of the plan@@ et@@ .
So, you know, it's got lo@@ ts of ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es a@@ he@@ ad@@ , but it is an ex@@ amp@@ le of the many h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds and h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of ide@@ as that we need to mo@@ ve for@@ war@@ d.
So let@@ 's thin@@ k@@ : How should we me@@ as@@ ure our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ?
What should our re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, let@@ 's go out to where we really need to get@@ , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate.
F@@ or 20@@ 5@@ 0@@ , you@@ 've hear@@ d many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion@@ . That really is very import@@ ant@@ , that we get there.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es, still some ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re,
h@@ o@@ pe@@ fu@@ ll@@ y we will have c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up for@@ est@@ r@@ y, c@@ ement@@ .
So, to get to that 8@@ 0 per@@ cent@@ , the develo@@ p@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es, inc@@ lu@@ ding coun@@ tri@@ es like Ch@@ in@@ a, will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity gener@@ ation alt@@ og@@ e@@ ther@@ .
So, the other gra@@ de is@@ : A@@ re we de@@ p@@ lo@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion technolo@@ g@@ y,
have we de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed it in all the develo@@ p@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es
and we're in the proc@@ ess of gett@@ ing it el@@ se@@ wh@@ er@@ e?
That's su@@ per import@@ ant@@ .
That's a k@@ ey el@@ em@@ ent of ma@@ king that re@@ por@@ t car@@ d.
So, bac@@ king up from ther@@ e, what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, again@@ , it should have the two el@@ ement@@ s.
We should go through these eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s to start gett@@ ing re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s@@ :
The l@@ ess we em@@ it, the l@@ ess that su@@ m will be of C@@ O@@ 2@@ , and, ther@@ e@@ for@@ e, the l@@ ess the tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re.
But in some wa@@ ys, the gra@@ de we get ther@@ e, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s, is only e@@ qu@@ ally, or ma@@ ybe even s@@ li@@ ght@@ ly l@@ es@@ s, important than the other@@ , which is the pi@@ ece of in@@ nov@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s.
Th@@ ese bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s, we need to mo@@ ve those at ful@@ l spe@@ ed, and we can me@@ as@@ ure that in ter@@ m@@ s of comp@@ ani@@ es, pi@@ lot projec@@ t@@ s, reg@@ ul@@ ator@@ y things that have been chang@@ ed.
Th@@ ere's a lot of great bo@@ o@@ ks that have been w@@ rit@@ t@@ en about this.
The A@@ l G@@ ore bo@@ o@@ k, "@@ O@@ u@@ r Ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e@@ " and the D@@ av@@ i@@ d M@@ c@@ K@@ a@@ y bo@@ o@@ k, "@@ Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able E@@ ner@@ gy W@@ i@@ th@@ out the H@@ o@@ t A@@ ir@@ ."
They really go through it and cre@@ ate a f@@ ram@@ e@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ s@@ ed b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly, because we need b@@ ro@@ ad bac@@ king for this.
Th@@ ere's a lot that has to come tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
So this is a wi@@ sh@@ .
It's a very con@@ cre@@ te w@@ is@@ h that we inv@@ ent this technolo@@ g@@ y.
If you g@@ ave me only one w@@ is@@ h for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k wh@@ o@@ 's pre@@ si@@ dent@@ , I could pic@@ k a v@@ acc@@ in@@ e, which is something I lo@@ v@@ e, or I could pic@@ k that this thing that's h@@ al@@ f the cos@@ t with no C@@ O@@ 2 get@@ s invent@@ ed -- this is the w@@ is@@ h I would pic@@ k.
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est imp@@ ac@@ t.
If we don't get this wi@@ sh@@ , the divi@@ sion between the people who think sh@@ or@@ t ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be ter@@ ri@@ bl@@ e, between the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Ch@@ in@@ a, between po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es and ri@@ ch@@ , and most of all the liv@@ es of those two bi@@ ll@@ ion will be far wor@@ s@@ e.
So, what do we have to do@@ ?
What am I ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to you to ste@@ p for@@ war@@ d and d@@ ri@@ ve@@ ?
We need to go for more re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch fun@@ d@@ ing.
When coun@@ tri@@ es get tog@@ ether in plac@@ es like C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en, they sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't just disc@@ us@@ s the C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
They should disc@@ us@@ s this in@@ nov@@ ation ag@@ end@@ a, and you@@ '@@ d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous@@ ly low l@@ ev@@ el@@ s of spen@@ ding on these in@@ nov@@ ative ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es.
We do need the mark@@ et in@@ cent@@ i@@ ves -- C@@ O@@ 2 ta@@ x@@ , ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that get@@ s that p@@ ric@@ e sign@@ al out there.
We need to get the m@@ ess@@ age ou@@ t.
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ ue be a more r@@ ation@@ al, more underst@@ and@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ u@@ e, inc@@ lu@@ ding the ste@@ p@@ s that the gover@@ n@@ ment ta@@ k@@ es.
This is an important wi@@ sh@@ , but it is one I think we can a@@ chi@@ ev@@ e.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to underst@@ and more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er, right --
I mean@@ , first of all@@ , can you give a sen@@ se of what sc@@ ale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is@@ ?
B@@ il G@@ at@@ es@@ : T@@ o actually do the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are, bu@@ y the super@@ comput@@ er, hi@@ re all the great sci@@ ent@@ ist@@ s, which we've don@@ e, that's only ten@@ s of mill@@ ion@@ s, and even on@@ ce we t@@ est our materi@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ t@@ or to make su@@ re that our materi@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly, then you@@ 'll only be up in the h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mill@@ ion@@ s.
The t@@ ou@@ gh thing is buil@@ ding the pi@@ lot re@@ ac@@ tor@@ ; fin@@ ding the se@@ ver@@ al bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ , fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ ator@@ , the lo@@ c@@ ation that will actually buil@@ d the first one of th@@ es@@ e.
O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t, if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ d, then it's just c@@ le@@ ar as da@@ y, because the econom@@ ic@@ s, the ener@@ gy den@@ sit@@ y, are so different than n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar as we know it.
C@@ A@@ : And so, to underst@@ and it ri@@ ght, this in@@ vol@@ ves buil@@ ding de@@ ep into the gro@@ un@@ d al@@ most like a ver@@ tic@@ al kind of co@@ lu@@ m@@ n of n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fu@@ el@@ , of this sort of spen@@ t ur@@ ani@@ um@@ ,
and then the proc@@ ess star@@ ts at the to@@ p and kind of wor@@ ks do@@ wn@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : That's ri@@ gh@@ t. T@@ o@@ da@@ y, you're always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , so you have lo@@ ts of people and lo@@ ts of contro@@ l@@ s that can go w@@ ron@@ g@@ : that thing where you're op@@ en@@ ing it up and mov@@ ing things in and ou@@ t,
that's not go@@ o@@ d.
So, if you have very ch@@ ea@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ iti@@ es.
And it just s@@ its there and b@@ ur@@ n@@ s for the 6@@ 0 year@@ s, and then it's don@@ e.
C@@ A@@ : It's a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar pow@@ er pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ st@@ e dis@@ pos@@ al solut@@ ion@@ .
B@@ G@@ : Y@@ ea@@ h@@ . Well, what happen@@ s with the wa@@ st@@ e, you can le@@ t it si@@ t there -- there's a lot l@@ ess wa@@ st@@ e un@@ der this ap@@ pro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and b@@ ur@@ n that.
And we start off actually by ta@@ king the wa@@ st@@ e that ex@@ ist@@ s to@@ da@@ y, that's sit@@ ting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or d@@ ry cas@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s --
that's our fu@@ el to be@@ g@@ in with@@ .
So, the thing that's been a prob@@ le@@ m from those re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s is actually what get@@ s f@@ ed into our@@ s, and you're re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ u@@ me of the wa@@ st@@ e qu@@ ite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically as you're going through this proc@@ ess@@ .
C@@ A@@ : I mean@@ , you're tal@@ king to different people around the world about the possibi@@ lit@@ i@@ es here. Wh@@ ere is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with th@@ is@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, we hav@@ en@@ 't pic@@ ked a partic@@ ul@@ ar plac@@ e, and there's all these interest@@ ing disc@@ lo@@ su@@ re r@@ ul@@ es about any@@ thing that's called "@@ n@@ uc@@ lear@@ ," so we've got a lot of interest@@ ,
that people from the comp@@ any have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a, Indi@@ a, Ch@@ ina --
I've been back se@@ e@@ ing the se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of ener@@ gy here,
tal@@ king about how this f@@ its into the ener@@ gy ag@@ end@@ a.
So I'm op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic@@ . You know, the F@@ r@@ enc@@ h and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have d@@ one some wor@@ k.
This is a v@@ ari@@ ant on something that has been don@@ e.
It's an important ad@@ v@@ anc@@ e, but it's like a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , and a lot of coun@@ tri@@ es have buil@@ t them@@ , so any@@ body wh@@ o@@ 's d@@ one a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ t@@ or is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one get@@ s buil@@ t.
C@@ A@@ : So, in your min@@ d, tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ h@@ ood of actually ta@@ king something like this li@@ ve@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, we need -- for one of these hi@@ gh@@ -@@ sc@@ ale, el@@ ec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that's very ch@@ e@@ ap@@ , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y.
That's sort of the de@@ ad@@ l@@ ine that the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al mo@@ de@@ l@@ s have sh@@ own us that we have to me@@ et@@ .
An@@ d, you know, T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er, if things go w@@ ell -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could ea@@ si@@ ly me@@ et that.
And there are, fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely no@@ w, do@@ z@@ en@@ s of comp@@ ani@@ es -- we need it to be h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds -- wh@@ o, li@@ ke@@ w@@ is@@ e, if their sci@@ ence go@@ es w@@ ell, if the fun@@ ding for their pi@@ lot pl@@ ant@@ s go@@ es w@@ ell, that they can comp@@ ete for this.
And it's b@@ est if m@@ ulti@@ p@@ le succ@@ e@@ ed, because then you could use a mi@@ x of these thing@@ s.
We cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed.
C@@ A@@ : In ter@@ m@@ s of bi@@ g@@ -@@ sc@@ ale possi@@ ble g@@ ame chang@@ es, is this the bi@@ gg@@ est that you're a@@ w@@ are of out ther@@ e?
B@@ G@@ : A@@ n ener@@ gy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing.
It would have be@@ en, even with@@ out the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al con@@ stra@@ int@@ , but the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al con@@ stra@@ int just ma@@ kes it so much gre@@ at@@ er.
In the n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar sp@@ ac@@ e, there are other in@@ nov@@ ator@@ s.
You know, we don't know their work as w@@ ell as we know this one, but the mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar peopl@@ e, that's a different ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ .
Th@@ ere's a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , which se@@ em@@ s a little har@@ d, but ma@@ ybe they say that about us@@ .
And so, there are different on@@ es, but the be@@ aut@@ y of this is a mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of ur@@ ani@@ u@@ m has a million tim@@ es as much ener@@ gy as a mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of@@ , say, co@@ al, and so -- if you can de@@ al with the ne@@ g@@ ativ@@ es, which are ess@@ enti@@ ally the ra@@ di@@ ation -- the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and cost@@ , the pot@@ enti@@ al, in ter@@ m@@ s of eff@@ ec@@ t on l@@ and and v@@ ari@@ ous thing@@ s, is al@@ most in a c@@ las@@ s of its ow@@ n@@ .
C@@ A@@ : If this doesn't wor@@ k, then wh@@ at@@ ?
D@@ o we have to start ta@@ king em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s to try and ke@@ ep the tem@@ per@@ atu@@ re of the ear@@ th st@@ ab@@ le@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : If you get into that s@@ itu@@ ation, it's like if you@@ 've been over@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ ing, and you're about to have a hear@@ t att@@ ac@@ k@@ :
Th@@ en where do you go@@ ? You may need hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y or some@@ thing.
There is a l@@ ine of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch on wh@@ at's called ge@@ o@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing, which are v@@ ari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would de@@ la@@ y the he@@ ating to bu@@ y us 20 or 3@@ 0 years to get our ac@@ t tog@@ e@@ ther@@ .
Now, that's just an in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce pol@@ ic@@ y.
You h@@ op@@ e you don't need to do that.
S@@ om@@ e people say you sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't even work on the in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce pol@@ ic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y, that you@@ 'll ke@@ ep e@@ ating because you know hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y will be there to s@@ ave you.
I'm not su@@ re that's w@@ is@@ e, gi@@ v@@ en the import@@ ance of the problem@@ , but there's now the ge@@ o@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing disc@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ c@@ k@@ et in cas@@ e things hap@@ pe@@ n f@@ ast@@ er, or this in@@ nov@@ ation go@@ es a lot s@@ low@@ er than we ex@@ pe@@ c@@ t@@ ?
C@@ A@@ : C@@ lim@@ ate s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s@@ : If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them@@ , how might you per@@ su@@ ad@@ e them that they're w@@ ron@@ g@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y, the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s come in different cam@@ p@@ s. The on@@ es who make sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c ar@@ gu@@ ment@@ s are very fe@@ w.
A@@ re they sa@@ ying that there's ne@@ g@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ec@@ ts that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ se@@ t thing@@ s@@ ?
There are ver@@ y, very few things that they can even say there's a ch@@ ance in a million of those thing@@ s. The ma@@ in prob@@ le@@ m we have here, it's kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ .
You make the mi@@ st@@ a@@ ke no@@ w, and you pa@@ y for it a lot lat@@ er.
And so, when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s, the idea of ta@@ king pa@@ in now that has to do with a g@@ a@@ in lat@@ er,
and a some@@ what un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in pa@@ in thing --
in fac@@ t, the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port@@ , that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y the wor@@ st cas@@ e, and there are people in the ric@@ h world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say, "@@ OK@@ , that is@@ n't that big of a de@@ al@@ ."
The fac@@ t is it's that un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in part that should mo@@ ve us to@@ war@@ ds this.
But my dre@@ am here is that, if you can make it econom@@ ic@@ , and me@@ et the C@@ O@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ int@@ s, then the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ s say, "@@ OK@@ , I don't c@@ are that it doesn't put out C@@ O@@ 2@@ , I kind of w@@ is@@ h it did put out C@@ O@@ 2@@ , but I gu@@ ess I'll acc@@ ep@@ t it because it's ch@@ ea@@ per than wh@@ at's come befor@@ e@@ ."
C@@ A@@ : And so, that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g ar@@ gu@@ ment@@ , that bas@@ ically if you spen@@ d all this ener@@ gy trying to sol@@ ve the C@@ O@@ 2 problem@@ , it's going to take a@@ way all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of po@@ ver@@ t@@ y and mal@@ ari@@ a and so for@@ th@@ , it's a stu@@ pi@@ d wa@@ st@@ e of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ 's re@@ s@@ our@@ c@@ es to put mon@@ ey to@@ war@@ ds that when there are better things we can do.
B@@ G@@ : Well, the actu@@ al spen@@ ding on the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D pi@@ ece --
say the U@@ .@@ S@@ . should spen@@ d 10 bi@@ ll@@ ion a ye@@ ar more than it is right now -- it's not that d@@ ram@@ at@@ ic@@ .
It sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't take a@@ way from other thing@@ s.
The thing you get into big mon@@ ey on, and this, reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ re@@ e, is when you have something that's n@@ on@@ -@@ econom@@ ic and you're trying to fun@@ d that --
that, to me, mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ st@@ e.
Un@@ l@@ ess you're very clo@@ se and you're just fun@@ ding the lear@@ ning cur@@ ve and it's going to get very ch@@ e@@ ap@@ , I beli@@ eve we should try more things that have a pot@@ enti@@ al to be far l@@ ess ex@@ pen@@ si@@ v@@ e.
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is, "@@ L@@ et@@ 's make ener@@ gy su@@ per ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve@@ ," then the ric@@ h can af@@ for@@ d that. I mean@@ , all of us here could pa@@ y fi@@ ve tim@@ es as much for our ener@@ gy and not change our lif@@ est@@ y@@ le.
The di@@ sa@@ st@@ er is for that two bi@@ ll@@ ion@@ .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chang@@ ed.
H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is, "@@ Wh@@ y is@@ n't the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D gett@@ ing more disc@@ us@@ se@@ d@@ ?"
H@@ e's st@@ ill@@ , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stu@@ ff@@ , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ ti@@ c cam@@ p@@ , but h@@ e's re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed that's a pre@@ tt@@ y lon@@ ely cam@@ p@@ , and so, h@@ e's ma@@ king the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D po@@ int@@ .
And so there is a thre@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ propri@@ ate.
The R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D pi@@ ec@@ e, it's c@@ ra@@ z@@ y how little it's fun@@ de@@ d.
C@@ A@@ : W@@ ell B@@ ill@@ , I s@@ us@@ pe@@ c@@ t I spe@@ a@@ k on the be@@ h@@ al@@ f of most people here to say I really h@@ op@@ e your w@@ is@@ h comes tr@@ u@@ e. Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .
B@@ G@@ : Thank you.
I'@@ d like to sh@@ are with you a dis@@ co@@ very that I made a few mon@@ th@@ s ag@@ o wh@@ ile w@@ rit@@ ing an ar@@ tic@@ le for It@@ ali@@ an W@@ i@@ re@@ d.
I always ke@@ ep my th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us h@@ and@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I'm w@@ rit@@ ing any@@ thing@@ , but I'@@ d al@@ read@@ y fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ed ed@@ it@@ ing the pi@@ ec@@ e, and I re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed that I had never on@@ ce in my life loo@@ ked up the wor@@ d "@@ dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed@@ " to see what I'@@ d fin@@ d.
L@@ et me re@@ ad you the ent@@ r@@ y.
"@@ D@@ is@@ ab@@ l@@ ed, ad@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve@@ : c@@ ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed, hel@@ pl@@ es@@ s, us@@ el@@ es@@ s, w@@ re@@ c@@ k@@ ed, st@@ all@@ ed, ma@@ im@@ ed, w@@ oun@@ de@@ d, man@@ g@@ l@@ ed, l@@ am@@ e, mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed, r@@ un@@ -@@ do@@ wn@@ , wor@@ n@@ -@@ ou@@ t, we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed, im@@ pot@@ ent@@ , ca@@ str@@ at@@ ed, par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed, h@@ and@@ ic@@ ap@@ pe@@ d, sen@@ il@@ e, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it, l@@ ai@@ d@@ -@@ up@@ , don@@ e-@@ up@@ , don@@ e-@@ for@@ , don@@ e-@@ in c@@ rac@@ k@@ ed@@ -@@ up@@ , coun@@ t@@ ed@@ -@@ out@@ ; see also h@@ ur@@ t, us@@ el@@ ess and we@@ a@@ k.
An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s, he@@ al@@ th@@ y, str@@ on@@ g@@ , cap@@ ab@@ le@@ ."
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing, it was so lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us@@ , but I'@@ d just go@@ tt@@ en pas@@ t "@@ man@@ g@@ l@@ ed@@ ," and my vo@@ ice b@@ ro@@ k@@ e, and I had to st@@ o@@ p and coll@@ ec@@ t m@@ y@@ sel@@ f from the em@@ ot@@ ion@@ al sh@@ oc@@ k and imp@@ ac@@ t that the as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t from these wor@@ ds un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed.
You know, of cour@@ se, this is my rag@@ g@@ ed@@ y old th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us
so I'm thin@@ king this m@@ ust be an an@@ ci@@ ent pr@@ int d@@ ate, ri@@ ght@@ ?
B@@ ut@@ , in fac@@ t, the pr@@ int d@@ ate was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s,
when I would have been star@@ ting pri@@ mar@@ y sch@@ oo@@ l and form@@ ing an underst@@ and@@ ing of m@@ y@@ sel@@ f out@@ si@@ de the fam@@ il@@ y un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other ki@@ ds and the world around me.
An@@ d, ne@@ ed@@ l@@ ess to say, th@@ ank G@@ od I was@@ n't us@@ ing a th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us back th@@ en@@ .
I mean@@ , from this ent@@ r@@ y, it would se@@ e@@ m that I was bor@@ n into a world that per@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ed some@@ one like me to have no@@ thing positi@@ ve wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever going for them@@ , when in fac@@ t, to@@ day I'm c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated for the op@@ port@@ un@@ iti@@ es and ad@@ vent@@ u@@ re@@ s my life has pro@@ cu@@ re@@ d.
So, I im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ l@@ ine ed@@ it@@ ion@@ , ex@@ pe@@ c@@ ting to find a re@@ vi@@ sion wor@@ th not@@ ing.
H@@ ere's the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this ent@@ r@@ y.
Un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y, it's not much bet@@ ter@@ .
I find the last two wor@@ ds un@@ der "@@ Ne@@ ar An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s@@ ," partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly un@@ s@@ ett@@ l@@ ing@@ : "@@ wh@@ ol@@ e@@ " and "@@ wh@@ ol@@ es@@ om@@ e@@ ." So, it's not just about the wor@@ d@@ s.
It's what we beli@@ eve about people when we n@@ ame them with these wor@@ d@@ s.
It's about the val@@ u@@ es be@@ h@@ in@@ d the wor@@ d@@ s, and how we con@@ struc@@ t those val@@ u@@ es.
O@@ u@@ r lan@@ gu@@ age aff@@ ec@@ ts our thin@@ king and how we vi@@ e@@ w the world and how we vi@@ e@@ w other peopl@@ e.
In fac@@ t, many an@@ ci@@ ent societ@@ i@@ es, inc@@ lu@@ ding the G@@ re@@ e@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ an@@ s, beli@@ ev@@ ed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so pow@@ er@@ ful@@ , because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d b@@ rou@@ ght it into ex@@ ist@@ enc@@ e.
So, what re@@ al@@ ity do we want to call into ex@@ ist@@ enc@@ e: a per@@ son who is lim@@ it@@ ed, or a per@@ son wh@@ o@@ 's em@@ pow@@ er@@ ed@@ ?
B@@ y cas@@ u@@ ally doing something as sim@@ p@@ le as nam@@ ing a person@@ , a chil@@ d, we might be p@@ ut@@ ting li@@ ds and ca@@ st@@ ing sh@@ a@@ do@@ w@@ s on their pow@@ er.
W@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't we want to o@@ pe@@ n do@@ or@@ s for them in@@ ste@@ ad@@ ?
O@@ ne su@@ ch per@@ son who op@@ en@@ ed do@@ or@@ s for me was my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood do@@ c@@ t@@ or at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ it@@ ute in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on, D@@ el@@ a@@ w@@ are.
H@@ is n@@ ame was D@@ r@@ . P@@ i@@ zz@@ uti@@ ll@@ o,
an It@@ ali@@ an Americ@@ an, wh@@ ose nam@@ e, ap@@ par@@ ent@@ ly, was to@@ o diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for most Americ@@ an@@ s to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ e, so he went by D@@ r@@ . P@@ .
And D@@ r@@ . P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful b@@ ow ti@@ es and had the very per@@ f@@ ec@@ t dis@@ positi@@ on to work with chil@@ d@@ ren@@ .
I lo@@ v@@ ed al@@ most every@@ thing about my time spen@@ t at this h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al, with the ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tion of my ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ es@@ sion@@ s.
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like in@@ numer@@ able re@@ pet@@ it@@ ions of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se@@ s with these th@@ ic@@ k, el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ and@@ s -- different col@@ or@@ s, you know -- to hel@@ p buil@@ d up my le@@ g mus@@ cl@@ es,
and I h@@ ated these b@@ and@@ s more than any@@ thing --
I h@@ ated them@@ , had nam@@ es for them. I h@@ ated them.
An@@ d, you know, I was al@@ read@@ y bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing, as a fi@@ ve year@@ -@@ old chil@@ d, with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ es, un@@ succ@@ ess@@ fu@@ ll@@ y, of cour@@ s@@ e.
An@@ d, one da@@ y, he came in to my s@@ essi@@ on -- ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ i@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ ing, these s@@ es@@ sion@@ s --
and he said to me, "@@ W@@ ow@@ . A@@ im@@ e@@ e, you are su@@ ch a str@@ ong and pow@@ er@@ ful little gi@@ r@@ l@@ , I think you're going to bre@@ a@@ k one of those b@@ and@@ s.
When you do bre@@ a@@ k it, I'm going to give you a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d b@@ uc@@ k@@ s@@ ."
Now, of cour@@ se, this was a sim@@ p@@ le p@@ lo@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P@@ 's part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se@@ s I didn't want to do befor@@ e the pro@@ spe@@ c@@ t of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old in the secon@@ d f@@ lo@@ or war@@ d, but what he eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely did for me was re@@ sh@@ ap@@ e an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ il@@ y oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence
into a new and pro@@ mis@@ ing ex@@ peri@@ ence for me.
And I have to won@@ der to@@ day to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vi@@ sion and his de@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and pow@@ er@@ ful little gi@@ r@@ l sh@@ ap@@ ed my own vi@@ e@@ w of m@@ y@@ sel@@ f as an in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly str@@ on@@ g@@ , pow@@ er@@ ful and a@@ th@@ let@@ ic per@@ son w@@ ell into the fut@@ u@@ re.
This is an ex@@ amp@@ le of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in pos@@ it@@ ions of pow@@ er can i@@ gn@@ ite the pow@@ er of a chil@@ d.
B@@ ut@@ , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous in@@ st@@ anc@@ es of those th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us ent@@ ri@@ es, our lan@@ gu@@ age is@@ n't al@@ low@@ ing us to evol@@ ve into the re@@ al@@ ity that we would all want@@ , the possibi@@ lit@@ y of an indi@@ vidu@@ al to see them@@ sel@@ ves as cap@@ ab@@ le.
O@@ u@@ r lan@@ gu@@ age h@@ as@@ n't ca@@ u@@ ght up with the chang@@ es in our societ@@ y, many of which have been b@@ rou@@ ght about by technolo@@ g@@ y.
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, from a med@@ ical st@@ and@@ po@@ int@@ , my leg@@ s, las@@ er sur@@ g@@ er@@ y for vi@@ sion imp@@ air@@ ment@@ , tit@@ ani@@ u@@ m k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ement@@ s for ag@@ ing bo@@ di@@ es that are al@@ low@@ ing people to more fu@@ ll@@ y eng@@ age with their abilit@@ i@@ es, and mo@@ ve be@@ y@@ on@@ d the lim@@ its that natu@@ re has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to ment@@ ion soci@@ al net@@ wor@@ king pl@@ at@@ form@@ s al@@ low people to self@@ -@@ id@@ enti@@ f@@ y, to cl@@ ai@@ m their own de@@ script@@ ions of them@@ sel@@ v@@ es, so they can go ali@@ gn with glob@@ al gro@@ up@@ s of their own ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing.
So, per@@ hap@@ s technolo@@ gy is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tr@@ u@@ th@@ : that every@@ one has something r@@ are and pow@@ er@@ ful to off@@ er our societ@@ y, and that the human abilit@@ y to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est ass@@ et@@ .
The human abilit@@ y to ad@@ ap@@ t, it's an interest@@ ing thing@@ , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y, and I'm going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion@@ :
This ph@@ r@@ ase never s@@ at right with me, and I always fel@@ t un@@ e@@ as@@ y trying to ans@@ w@@ er peopl@@ e's question@@ s about it, and I think I'm star@@ ting to fi@@ gu@@ re out wh@@ y.
I@@ m@@ plic@@ it in this ph@@ r@@ ase of "@@ over@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ " is the idea that succ@@ es@@ s, or hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s, is about em@@ er@@ g@@ ing on the other si@@ de of a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing ex@@ peri@@ ence un@@ s@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e, as if my succ@@ es@@ se@@ s in life have come about from an abilit@@ y to si@@ de@@ ste@@ p or cir@@ cu@@ m@@ n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate the pre@@ su@@ m@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ all@@ s of a life with pro@@ s@@ th@@ et@@ ic@@ s, or what other people per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve as my di@@ sa@@ bilit@@ y.
B@@ ut@@ , in fac@@ t, we are chang@@ ed. We are mark@@ ed, of cour@@ se, by a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e, wh@@ ether ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally, em@@ ot@@ ion@@ ally or bo@@ th@@ .
And I'm going to su@@ gg@@ est that this is a good thing.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is@@ n't an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in or@@ der to re@@ su@@ me liv@@ ing our lif@@ e.
It's part of our lif@@ e.
And I ten@@ d to think of it like my sh@@ a@@ do@@ w.
S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es I see a lot of it, som@@ et@@ im@@ es there's very lit@@ t@@ le, but it's always with me.
An@@ d, cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, I'm not trying to di@@ min@@ is@@ h the imp@@ ac@@ t, the we@@ i@@ ght, of a person@@ 's stru@@ gg@@ le.
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge in lif@@ e, and it's all very real and rel@@ ative to every sing@@ le person@@ , but the quest@@ ion is@@ n't wh@@ ether or not you're going to me@@ et ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y, but how you're going to me@@ et it.
So, our respon@@ si@@ bilit@@ y is not sim@@ pl@@ y shi@@ el@@ ding those we c@@ are for from ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y, but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it w@@ ell@@ .
And we do a dis@@ serv@@ ice to our ki@@ ds when we make them fe@@ el that they're not e@@ qui@@ pp@@ ed to ad@@ ap@@ t.
Th@@ ere's an important differ@@ ence and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the ob@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve med@@ ical fac@@ t of my being an amp@@ ut@@ e@@ e and the sub@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve societ@@ al op@@ ini@@ on of wh@@ ether or not I'm dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed.
An@@ d, tr@@ u@@ th@@ fu@@ ll@@ y, the only real and con@@ sist@@ ent di@@ sa@@ bilit@@ y I've had to con@@ fron@@ t is the world ever thin@@ king that I could be de@@ scri@@ b@@ ed by those defin@@ it@@ ion@@ s.
In our desi@@ re to pro@@ tec@@ t those we c@@ are about by gi@@ v@@ ing them the col@@ d, h@@ ard tr@@ ut@@ h about their med@@ ical pro@@ g@@ no@@ si@@ s, or@@ , in@@ de@@ ed, a pro@@ g@@ no@@ si@@ s on the ex@@ pe@@ c@@ ted qual@@ ity of their lif@@ e, we have to make su@@ re that we don't put the first b@@ ric@@ k in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one.
Per@@ hap@@ s the ex@@ ist@@ ing mo@@ del of only looking at what is b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in you and how do we fi@@ x it, serv@@ es to be more dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ing to the indi@@ vidu@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y it@@ self@@ .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person@@ , by not ac@@ know@@ l@@ ed@@ g@@ ing their pot@@ enc@@ y, we are cre@@ ating another ill on to@@ p of wh@@ at@@ ever natu@@ ral stru@@ gg@@ le they might hav@@ e.
We are eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely gra@@ ding some@@ on@@ e's wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity.
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y and into the r@@ ang@@ e of human ca@@ pa@@ bilit@@ y.
An@@ d, most import@@ ant@@ ly, there's a part@@ ner@@ shi@@ p between those per@@ ce@@ i@@ v@@ ed de@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative abilit@@ y.
So it's not about de@@ val@@ u@@ ing, or ne@@ g@@ at@@ ing, these more trying tim@@ es as something we want to av@@ o@@ i@@ d or s@@ we@@ ep un@@ der the ru@@ g@@ , but in@@ ste@@ ad to find those op@@ port@@ un@@ iti@@ es w@@ ra@@ pp@@ ed in the ad@@ vers@@ ity.
So ma@@ ybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is op@@ en@@ ing our@@ sel@@ ves up to it, em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it, gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it, to use a w@@ rest@@ l@@ ing ter@@ m@@ , ma@@ ybe even d@@ anc@@ ing with it.
An@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s, if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natur@@ al, con@@ sist@@ ent and us@@ e@@ ful@@ , we're l@@ ess b@@ ur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it.
This ye@@ ar we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the 200@@ th bi@@ r@@ th@@ day of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in, and it was 1@@ 50 years ag@@ o, when w@@ rit@@ ing about evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ , that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ill@@ u@@ str@@ at@@ ed, I thin@@ k, a tr@@ ut@@ h about the human ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ .
T@@ o par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ as@@ e: It's not the str@@ on@@ g@@ est of the speci@@ es that sur@@ viv@@ es, no@@ r is it the most intell@@ ig@@ ent that sur@@ viv@@ es@@ ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to chang@@ e.
Con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation.
F@@ ro@@ m D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ 's wor@@ k, am@@ on@@ g@@ st other@@ s, we can re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ ze that the human abilit@@ y to sur@@ vi@@ ve and fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h is d@@ riv@@ en by the stru@@ gg@@ le of the human spi@@ ri@@ t through con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t into trans@@ form@@ ation.
So, again@@ , trans@@ form@@ ation, ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation, is our gre@@ at@@ est human s@@ ki@@ ll@@ .
An@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l we're test@@ ed, we don't know what we're made of@@ .
Ma@@ ybe that's what ad@@ vers@@ ity gi@@ ves us@@ : a sen@@ se of self@@ , a sen@@ se of our own pow@@ er.
So, we can give our@@ sel@@ ves a gi@@ f@@ t.
We can re@@ -@@ imag@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ou@@ gh tim@@ es.
Ma@@ ybe we can see it as chang@@ e.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we hav@@ en@@ 't ad@@ ap@@ ted our@@ sel@@ ves to y@@ et@@ .
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we've cre@@ ated for our@@ sel@@ ves is this idea of nor@@ m@@ alc@@ y. Now, wh@@ o@@ 's nor@@ mal@@ ?
Th@@ ere's no nor@@ mal@@ . Th@@ ere's com@@ mon@@ , there's t@@ y@@ pic@@ al. Th@@ ere's no nor@@ mal@@ ,
and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or@@ , be@@ i@@ ge per@@ son if they ex@@ ist@@ ed@@ ?
I don't think s@@ o.
If we can change this par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m from one of a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing nor@@ m@@ alc@@ y to one of possibi@@ lit@@ y -- or pot@@ enc@@ y, to be even a little bit more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous -- we can re@@ le@@ ase the pow@@ er of so many more chil@@ d@@ ren@@ , and in@@ vit@@ e them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abilit@@ i@@ es with the commun@@ ity.
An@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ st@@ s tell us that the one thing we as hu@@ man@@ s have always re@@ qui@@ red of our commun@@ ity mem@@ ber@@ s is to be of us@@ e, to be able to cont@@ ri@@ b@@ ut@@ e.
Th@@ ere's e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ al@@ s, 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ag@@ o, car@@ ri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with seri@@ ous ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, and per@@ hap@@ s it's because the life ex@@ peri@@ ence of sur@@ viv@@ al of these people prov@@ ed of val@@ ue to the commun@@ ity. They didn't vi@@ e@@ w these people as b@@ ro@@ k@@ en and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ; they were se@@ en as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ ab@@ le.
A few years ag@@ o, I was in a f@@ ood mark@@ et in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a,
and I was st@@ and@@ ing over a bus@@ h@@ el of t@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ es.
It was su@@ m@@ mer@@ ti@@ me@@ : I had sh@@ or@@ ts on.
I he@@ ar this gu@@ y, his vo@@ ice be@@ h@@ in@@ d me say, "@@ Well, if it is@@ n't A@@ im@@ e@@ e M@@ u@@ ll@@ in@@ s@@ ." And I tur@@ n ar@@ oun@@ d, and it's this ol@@ der man@@ . I have no idea who he is.
And I said, "@@ I'm sor@@ r@@ y, si@@ r@@ , have we met@@ ? I don't rem@@ em@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing you@@ ." He said, "@@ Well, you w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't rem@@ em@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing me.
I mean@@ , when we me@@ t I was de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther@@ 's w@@ om@@ b@@ ."
O@@ h, that gu@@ y.
An@@ d, but of cour@@ se, actu@@ ally, it did cl@@ ic@@ k.
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an, a man that I had only kno@@ wn about through my mo@@ ther@@ 's stori@@ es of that da@@ y, be@@ caus@@ e, of cour@@ se, t@@ y@@ pic@@ al f@@ as@@ h@@ ion@@ , I arriv@@ ed l@@ ate for my bi@@ r@@ th@@ day by two we@@ e@@ k@@ s.
And so my mo@@ ther@@ 's pren@@ at@@ al ph@@ y@@ s@@ ici@@ an had g@@ one on v@@ ac@@ ation, so the man who de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed me was a compl@@ ete str@@ ang@@ er to my par@@ ent@@ s.
An@@ d, because I was bor@@ n with@@ out the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ on@@ es, and had fe@@ et tur@@ ned in, and a few to@@ es in this f@@ oo@@ t and a few to@@ es in that, he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s.
He said to me, "@@ I had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ si@@ s to your par@@ ent@@ s that you would never w@@ al@@ k, and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bilit@@ y that other ki@@ ds have or any kind of life of in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ enc@@ e, and you@@ 've been ma@@ king li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce@@ ." The ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary thing is that he said he had s@@ av@@ ed ne@@ w@@ sp@@ a@@ per c@@ li@@ pp@@ ing@@ s throu@@ gh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ h@@ oo@@ d, wh@@ ether w@@ in@@ ning a secon@@ d gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e,
mar@@ ch@@ ing with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ co@@ ut@@ s, you know, the H@@ al@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ a@@ de, w@@ in@@ ning my coll@@ eg@@ e sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ , or any of my s@@ port@@ s vic@@ t@@ ori@@ es, and he was us@@ ing it, and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into te@@ ach@@ ing re@@ si@@ d@@ ent stu@@ dent@@ s, m@@ ed stu@@ dent@@ s from H@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ n M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ ch@@ oo@@ l and H@@ er@@ sh@@ ey M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ ch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
And he called this part of the cour@@ se the X F@@ ac@@ tor@@ , the pot@@ enti@@ al of the human wi@@ ll@@ .
N@@ o pro@@ g@@ no@@ si@@ s can ac@@ coun@@ t for how pow@@ er@@ ful this could be as a de@@ termin@@ ant in the qual@@ ity of some@@ on@@ e's lif@@ e.
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me, he said, "@@ In my ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ e, un@@ l@@ ess re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly t@@ old other@@ w@@ is@@ e, and even if gi@@ v@@ en a mo@@ dic@@ u@@ m of sup@@ port@@ , if le@@ ft to their own de@@ vic@@ es, a chil@@ d will a@@ chi@@ ev@@ e@@ ."
S@@ e@@ e, D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an made that sh@@ if@@ t in thin@@ k@@ ing.
He underst@@ ood that there's a differ@@ ence between the med@@ ical con@@ d@@ iti@@ on and what some@@ one might do with it.
And there's been a sh@@ if@@ t in my thin@@ king over time, in that, if you had as@@ ked me at 1@@ 5 years ol@@ d, if I would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ th@@ et@@ ic@@ s for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s, I w@@ ou@@ l@@ dn't have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a secon@@ d.
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ m@@ alc@@ y back th@@ en@@ .
But if you as@@ k me to@@ da@@ y, I'm not so su@@ re.
And it's because of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es I've had with them@@ , not in sp@@ ite of the ex@@ peri@@ enc@@ es I've had with them.
And per@@ hap@@ s this sh@@ if@@ t in me has happen@@ ed because I've been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have op@@ en@@ ed do@@ or@@ s for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cas@@ t sh@@ a@@ do@@ w@@ s on me.
S@@ e@@ e, all you really need is one per@@ son to show you the e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any of your own pow@@ er, and you're off@@ . If you can h@@ and some@@ body the k@@ ey to their own pow@@ er -- the human spi@@ ri@@ t is so re@@ ce@@ p@@ ti@@ ve -- if you can do that and o@@ pe@@ n a do@@ or for some@@ one at a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al mom@@ ent@@ , you are ed@@ uc@@ ating them in the b@@ est sen@@ s@@ e.
Y@@ ou@@ 're te@@ ach@@ ing them to o@@ pe@@ n do@@ or@@ s for them@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
In fac@@ t, the ex@@ ac@@ t mean@@ ing of the wor@@ d "@@ ed@@ uc@@ at@@ e@@ " comes from the ro@@ o@@ t wor@@ d "@@ ed@@ uc@@ e@@ ." It mean@@ s "@@ to br@@ ing for@@ th what is wi@@ thin@@ , to br@@ ing out pot@@ enti@@ al@@ ."
So again@@ , which pot@@ enti@@ al do we want to br@@ ing out@@ ?
There was a cas@@ e stud@@ y d@@ one in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s B@@ rit@@ ain@@ , when they were mov@@ ing from gram@@ ma@@ r sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s.
It's called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ al@@ s. We call it "@@ tr@@ ac@@ k@@ ing@@ " here in the St@@ at@@ es.
It's se@@ par@@ ating stu@@ dent@@ s from A@@ , B@@ , C@@ , D and so on.
And the "@@ A stu@@ dent@@ s@@ " get the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um@@ , the b@@ est te@@ ach@@ er@@ s, et@@ c@@ . Well, they to@@ o@@ k, over a thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d, D@@ -@@ l@@ ev@@ el stu@@ dent@@ s, g@@ ave them A@@ '@@ s, t@@ old them they were "@@ A@@ '@@ s@@ ," t@@ old them they were bri@@ ght,
and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d, they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ l@@ ev@@ el@@ . An@@ d, of cour@@ se, the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing, f@@ li@@ p si@@ de of this stud@@ y, is that they to@@ ok the "@@ A stu@@ dent@@ s@@ " and t@@ old them they were "@@ D@@ '@@ s@@ ." And that's what happen@@ ed at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d.
Th@@ ose who were still around in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , b@@ es@@ ide@@ s the people who had d@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed ou@@ t.
A c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al part of this cas@@ e stud@@ y was that the te@@ ach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed to@@ o.
The te@@ ach@@ ers didn't know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been ma@@ de.
They were sim@@ pl@@ y t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ Th@@ ese are the '@@ A@@ -@@ stu@@ dent@@ s@@ ,@@ ' these are the '@@ D@@ -@@ stu@@ dent@@ s@@ .@@ '@@ "
And that's how they went about te@@ ach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them.
So, I think that the only tr@@ ue di@@ sa@@ bilit@@ y is a c@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ ed spi@@ rit@@ , a spi@@ ri@@ t that's been c@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn't have h@@ op@@ e,
it doesn't see be@@ aut@@ y,
it no lon@@ g@@ er has our natur@@ al, chil@@ d@@ like cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate abilit@@ y to imag@@ in@@ e.
If in@@ ste@@ ad@@ , we can b@@ ol@@ st@@ er a human spi@@ ri@@ t to ke@@ ep h@@ op@@ e, to see be@@ aut@@ y in them@@ sel@@ ves and other@@ s, to be cu@@ ri@@ ous and imag@@ in@@ ativ@@ e, then we are tr@@ ul@@ y us@@ ing our pow@@ er w@@ ell@@ .
When a spi@@ ri@@ t has those qual@@ iti@@ es, we are able to cre@@ ate new re@@ al@@ iti@@ es and new ways of be@@ ing.
I'@@ d like to le@@ ave you with a po@@ e@@ m by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my fri@@ en@@ d, J@@ acqu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is t@@ old me ab@@ ou@@ t,
and the po@@ e@@ m is called "@@ The G@@ od W@@ ho O@@ n@@ ly K@@ no@@ w@@ s F@@ our W@@ ord@@ s@@ "@@ : "@@ E@@ very chil@@ d has kno@@ wn Go@@ d, not the G@@ od of nam@@ es, not the G@@ od of don@@ '@@ t@@ s, but the G@@ od who only know@@ s f@@ our wor@@ ds and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them@@ , sa@@ y@@ ing, '@@ Come d@@ ance with me. Com@@ e, d@@ ance with me. Com@@ e, d@@ ance with me@@ .@@ '@@ "
Thank you.
